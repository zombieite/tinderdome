ZED (broken hill actor Bryce Educombe, Greg Bell sounds like he wants to do it, he's deaf but can speak? or ask Paul Colyle? or Stuart Batten? or John Devilman if he can make it?): BB's creepy coworker. Inadequate, insecure, ineffectual, inferior, but angry. 7SP employee. Grey denim work vest with 7SP patch, lighter blue bandana. Same hat as BB (which makes BB's hat appear less signficant). Try to get Ken May or Bill Williams or John Devilman.

EXTRAS (Rob Sheean, Gina Ferguson, friend Helen): Employees of 7SP. Mechanics, office workers, engineers, with outfits from dystopian pre-apocalyptic 1981. Some can be wearing the spare 7SP vests we'll have with us, or other spare wasteland gear we bring.

ORIGINAL MAD MAX 2 SCRIPT INTRO https://imsdb.com/scripts/Mad-Max-2-The-Road-Warrior.html
------

         Ih. A LINE OF CARS... lh.
          stretches for blocks until it finally reaches
          a gas station.
          An attendant pulls down a sign which reads:
                         $7/GALLON
          and replaces it with another sign:
          AUTHORISED VEHICLES ONLY
          A group of angry motorists gather around, yelling
          and pushing.
          The attendant produces a gun motioning them back...
                         NARRATOR
          for without fuel they were
          nothing. They had built a
          house of straw...
          ii. BUSINESSMEN AT A STOCK EXCHANGE... li.
          are yelling and shoving.
                         BUSINESSMEN
          Sell! Sell! Sell!
          Torn up scrip litters the floor...
          Ij. THE FOYER OF A HUGE CORPORATION lj.
          The company's crest is chiselled on the wall. it
          is accompanied by the words:
          SEVEN SISTERS PETROLEUM
          "Fuelling The World"
          on the floor below, beyond the marble pillars, we see
          the building is abandoned - littered with broken
          furniture and piles of documents.
           DISSOLVE. 4            
          lk. A CORRIDOR. 1k.
          We pass through a door designated:
          CHIEF EXECUTIVE
          At the other end of the imposing room we see a
          businessman clearing out his vast desk. His name is
          PAPPAGALLO. On the wall behind him we see photo-
          graphs and paintings of oil wells and refineries.
          PAPPAGALLO takes a wad of maps and puts them in his
          briefcase, followed by a copy of 'Whole Earth
          Catalogue" and another book. The cover reads:
          TEACH YOURSELF SOLAR ENERGY
          I.l. LIVING ROOM. ii.
          An ANXIOUS FAMILY is gathered in front of a
          television set. A politican addresses the nation.
                         POLITICIAN
          Stage three of the national
          emergency is effective
          immediately. Citizens are
          warned...
          The speech is cut short as static fills the screen.
          The family looks up at the lights as they flicker...
          Im. IN A FACTORY... lm.
          .a giant machine grinds to a halt.
          In. IN A CITY STREET... In.
          .anxious faces look up as the street lights
          flick off.
