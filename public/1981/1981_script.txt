1981
----

SCENE 1

(BLACK SCREEN) We hear the muffled sound of a heartbeat at 80bpm. Neatly hand-painted credits appear. The heartbeat is joined by the muffled sound of a music box playing Happy Birthday. It sounds like the listener is underwater. 
(HOUSE) Downward horizontal wipe reveals closeup of DEBORAH's pregnant belly as she sits or lies on the bed. The heartbeat sound fades out as the music box sound becomes unmuffled and clear. DEBORAH's hands are holding a music box to her tummy and turning it. Then the title "1981" appears in a font that takes up the whole screen. BB is in bed beside her snoring and TV/radio is also playing in the background. faintly. TV/radio grows louder as DEBORAH gets up and prepares breakfast. NYC has just reported another explosion--a FALN bomb is suspected, chilean libertadores, everything I list in the beginning of A-N-D, Government instability, viruses, overpopulation, and scientists haven't come to an agreement yet but some say we could be headed for a new Ice Age. Other radio announcer chimes in with some quip about how good that would feel right now, with this January heat. Unemployment is now 60%, violent crime is up 300%, solved crimes are at an all-time low as the country is enveloped by anarchy, and last month's Tynong North murders Bertha Miller (75), Catherine Headland (14), and Ann-Marie Sargent (18) are still unsolved. Inflation is now 400%, oil prices have increased by 1000% and prime minister Malcolm Fraser just announced that oil companies have been nationalised. "Stage three of the national emergency is effective immediately. Citizens are warned...." DEBORAH turns off the radio. The speech is cut short as static fills the screen. BB is 17. BB wears a hat (or doesn't have a mohawk yet) and his nametag that says "Bruce" is revealed early, to hide the fact that he is Wez. BB, dyed red hair, a rebellious punk but dressed in his mechanic coveralls for work, his patch reads Barbagallo. DEBORAH is speaking to him in a low, sexy aussie accent and cuddling him. "Time to get up Brucie." get mic CLOSE to DEBORAH's mouth so it sounds the way it would sound to bruce. "worked late again? slept in your clothes?" BB says yeah PG has been working them to death. He's been preparing for something but he won't say what it is. DEBORAH hands him a bacon egg roll for him to take to work. BB kisses her goodbye and kisses her pregnant belly. BB says "If it weren't for you, I'd burn this whole goddamn world to the ground." DEBORAH returns to bedroom to find a human-shaped stain of oil on the sheets.

SCENE 2

(7SP OFFICE) BB arrives at work. He joins up with Neil and Zed, also arriving at work, dressed similarly. They have to accommodate Neil's wheelchair(?). Zed is doing something with a knife (shaving, throwing it) and his vest says KILL KILL KILL on the back. He asks if they've heard the rumour. Rumour is that some of them are being offered a special job. Then Zed says something creepy and suggestive about BB's wife, about how they were dating once, he still loves her and she was meant for him. Says she's "really toey." Makes some joke about having sex with a pregnant lady means you're kind of having sex with the baby too. BB lunges for him. Neil grabs his arm, very strongly and tightly. But BB is strong too, and still tugging, and the camera looks at the wheels of the wheelchair and we see the chair slide sideways a bit. Neil says "leave him be, he's so dumb he doesn't even understand the words that come out of his own mouth. they went on one date back in school. he's all talk. he's a virgin. his mother won't even kiss him. and she'd never go for him. no one would. he'd never try anything. especially not with you around." cut to PG's office with nameplate on desk. PG is also listening to the radio, which is now going deeper into the subject of oil nationalisation. PG is going through a list of employees, Closeup of his pen circling some names and crossing out others. PG notices BB has arrived at work and goes out to talk to him while he works on repairing a vehicle. PG explains he's shutting down the company. "I'm gonna burn it all down so there's nothing for them to seize. All of it but one well we're gonna turn into a refinery, so we can produce petrol right on site and use it to barter with." PG invites Bruce to come to compound. Puffs him up with compliments about how he's the best mechanic I've got. BB says no he's not. Neil is. Why not take Neil? PG says something rude about how they can't have a cripple there slowing everything down, and "he'd need a better way to get around than that" (foreshadowing the rig he has in MM2). BB asks if DEBORAH goes too. PG says BB can't take DEBORAH along yet. Can't have dead weight mulling about, getting in the way. ONeile the compound is built he can send for her. 4 weeks. 6 at the most. It seems quite possible PG is just saying this to trick BB into coming and leaving DEBORAH behind. BB says nationalisation isn't a bad thing. He gives some examples of South American "suZedesses." "They're not gonna fire us, they're just gonna take some of the profits out of YOUR wallet. But that oil doesn't belong to you. It belongs to the people of Australia. It belongs to the whole world. It belongs to everyone BUT you." PG insults BB and his wife and friends and says "the vermin have inherited the earth. the world is going to the dogs. You wanna run with the dogs? what do you want to do, stay here and hang out with those punks? those hoodlums? runaways? misfits? gangsters? come with me. we'll live like kings. and I know you need the money. I can give you your last paycheck if you like. but you and I both know that cash isn't worth anything at this point. A better life awaits us out in the desert." PG harangues BB to join him, until BB puNeilhes him, shot just like MM2 scene with Max at 0:59. PG goes over to invite Zed to join him instead.

SCENE 3

(HOUSE) BB goes home and tells DEBORAH what's going on. She asks how long he would have to be gone for. 4-6 weeks. DEBORAH (give her some very intelligent lines, so she's not seen as just a birthing vessel) is worried about their future and tells him to go back and aZedept the offer. She says she's been alone before and she can do it again. Baby's not due for another 2 months.

SCENE 4

(7SP OFFICE) BB goes back and accepts PG's offer. PG casually tells Zed he's fired and to fuck off. Zed starts to give them trouble but BB goes after him and he runs away "He said fuck off." Need to express that Zed is very mad at hurt and somehow makes it clear he wants revenge at this point, or give him more motivation based on additional story events.

SCENE 5

(7SP OFFICE) PG (alone, night) clearing out his vast desk. On the wall behind him we see photographs and paintings of oil wells and refineries. PG takes a wad of maps and puts them in his briefcase, followed by a copy of Whole Earth Catalogue and another book. The cover reads: TEACH YOURSELF SOLAR ENERGY. PG dumps petrol (water) from a jerry can all over the 7SP office. We cut to PG's face. He lights a match and tosses it. His face suddenly becomes lit by a flickering orange light.

SCENE 6

(COMPOUND) PG, BB, and employees are working on building the compound up. They've clearly made a lot of progress and it's almost ready to go. BB asks PG if he can send for DEBORAH now. PG says "You can send for her, but if she doesn't have any skills, she'll have to be... well... community property." CURMUDGEON interjects, explaining: "Breeding stock." (If we have anyone dressed as CURMUDGEON, they can have that line). BB tries to attack PG but his minions stop him. They throw BB out of the compound. BB leaves in anger.

SCENE 7

(BLACK SCREEN) Just like at the beginning, muffled sound of a slow heartbeat. And the muffled sound of music box playing Happy Birthday. But we omit the last note as the sound is interrupted by the muffled sound of a door being broken down. And the heartbeat DOUBLING in speed. We hear DEBORAH make a muffled gasp. We hear muffled footsteps. Then we hear the muffled sounds of a struggle and DEBORAH screaming, then the screams die down. Then the heartbeat stops.
(HOUSE) Zed (not sure if we wanna show his face or have it be implied, do both takes) reaches down, sets down a bloody knife, and takes the music box out of DEBORAH's dead hand. DEBORAH's hand has the imprint of the music box in bruises and blood in her hand, from squeezing it so tightly (use red pen and fake blood). The camera sees some skin but nothing too racy or gory. We hear Zed walk away and out the broken door.
(HOUSE) Camera holds on doorway after Zed leaves. It stays there for a while. Long enough for Zed to vanish, and long enough for BB to get home, come into the doorway, and see his wife dead. Takes off hat, reveals mohawk. Implied: BB has to cut baby Steven out of his dead pregnant wife's body.

SCENE 8

(7SP OFFICE) Camera closeup of PG's burning employee list. Camera continues the downward motion it was making earlier, when it had a closeup of PG's pen. Moving downward, it indicates BB's name. BB's address: Werrington NSW. Notes: nickname "Wez",

          stretches for blocks until it finally reaches
          a gas station.
          An attendant pulls down a sign which reads:

          and replaces it with another sign:
          AUTHORISED VEHICLES ONLY
          A group of angry motorists gather around, yelling
          and pushing.
          The attendant produces a gun motioning them back...

          is accompanied by the words:
          SEVEN SISTERS PETROLEUM
          "Fuelling The World"
          on the floor below, beyond the marble pillars, we see
          the building is abandoned - littered with broken
          furniture and piles of documents.

          We pass through a door designated:
          • CHIEF EXECUTIVE
          At the other end of the imposing room we see a
          businessman clearing out his vast desk. His name is
          PAPPAGALLO. On the wall behind him we see photo-
          graphs and paintings of oil wells and refineries.
          PAPPAGALLO takes a wad of maps and puts them in his
          briefcase, followed by a copy of 'Whole Earth
          Catalogue" and another book. The cover reads:
