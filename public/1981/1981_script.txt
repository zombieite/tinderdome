DEBBY turns off the radio and now the camera is paying attention to her again. DEBBY brings a bacon egg roll to her sleeping partner. BB slept in his work clothes. Camera reveals that his nametag patch reads "Bruce." DEBBY comes in and speaks to him in a sweet, low voice. 

DEBBY: "Time to get up Brucie." Closeup shot of her whispering in his ear. Get mic close to DEBBY's mouth so it sounds the way it would sound to BB. 

BRUCE: Mumbles.

DEBBY: "You got home late didn't you?" She tries to put the food in his mouth but just gets grease on his face.

BB: Wakes up and does some barely-passable preparations for work. "PG is preparing for something big but he won't say what." BB succinctly makes it clear he doesn't like PG and doesn't like that PG gets to be in a position where he can extract the excess value of BB's labour. "Would you wrap up that sandwich for me?"

DEBBY: "Sandwiches." She hands him 3 sandwiches wrapped in yesterday's newspaper. 

BB: Kisses her goodbye and kisses her pregnant belly. BB says "If it weren't for you, I'd blow up this whole bloody world." 

DEBBY: Eating another one of the sandwiches, returns to bedroom to find a human-shaped oil stain on the sheets. She sighs.

BB: Heads off to work. It's clearly a long distance he has to travel.

------ SCENE 3 ------ 

(7SP OFFICE, morning)

Closeup of knife bouncing off some kind of target. Cut to ZED who's throwing it, and NEIL (in wheelchair) watching.

BB arrives at work. He joins up with NEIL and ZED, also arriving at work, dressed similarly. BB tosses them each a sandwich.

ZED throws knife again, it bounces off the target.

The back of his ZED's vest says "I DON'T LIKE MONDAYS EITHER." He asks if they've heard the rumour. Rumour is that some of them are being offered a special job. Then ZED says something creepy and suggestive about BB's wife, about how they were dating once, he still loves her and she was meant for him. Says she's "really toey." Makes some joke about having sex with a pregnant lady means you're kind of having sex with the baby too.

BB: Gives a cold look. "You're lucky I'm a pacifist."

NEIL: "Zed's so dumb he doesn't understand the words that come out of his own mouth. They went on one date back in school. He's all talk. His mother won't even kiss him. Debby would never go for him. No one would. He'd never try anything. Not with you around."

ZED throws knife again, it bounces off the target.

PG appears right where the knife just bounced off the wall. "Bruce can you come see me in my office?"

ZED and NEIL: Make juvenile noises like BB is in trouble with the school principal.

(7SP OFFICE INTERIOR, morning)

BB joins PG in office. PG explains he's shutting down the company. "I'm gonna burn it all down so there's nothing for them to seize. All of it but one well we're gonna turn into a refinery, so we can produce petrol right on site and use it to barter with." PG invites Bruce to come to compound. Puffs him up with compliments about how he's the best mechanic I've got. BB says no he's not. NEIL is. Why not take NEIL? PG says something rude about how they can't have a cripple there slowing everything down, and "he'd need a better way to get around than that" (foreshadowing the rig he has in MM2). BB asks if DEBBY goes too. PG says BB can't take DEBBY along yet. Can't have dead weight mulling about, getting in the way. Once the compound is built he can send for her. 4 weeks. 6 at the most. It seems quite possible PG is just saying this to trick BB into coming and leaving DEBBY behind. At some point BB gets sick of the conversation and they move out into the yard where BB can get to work on a car he's supposed to be fixing.

(7SP OFFICE EXTERIOR, morning)

BB says nationalisation isn't a bad thing. He gives some examples of South American "successes." "They're not gonna fire us, they're just gonna take some of the profits out of YOUR wallet. But that oil doesn't belong to you. It belongs to the people of Australia. It belongs to the whole world. It belongs to everyone BUT you." PG insults BB and his wife and friends and says "the vermin have inherited the earth. the world is going to the dogs. You wanna run with the dogs? what do you want to do, stay here and hang out with those punks? those hoodlums? runaways? misfits? gangsters? come with me. we'll live like kings. and I know you need the money. I can give you your last paycheck if you like. but you and I both know that cash isn't worth anything at this point. A better life awaits us out in the desert." PG harangues BB to join him, until BB punches him, shot just like MM2 scene with Max at 0:59. PG goes over to invite ZED to join him instead. He then returns to his office.

(7SP OFFICE INTERIOR, morning)

Inside PG's office with nameplate on desk. On the wall behind him we see a framed photograph of oil derricks. PG is going through a list of employees, Closeup of his pen circling ZED's name and crossing out BB's.

------ SCENE 4 ------ 

(HOUSE INTERIOR, midday)

BB goes home and tells DEBBY what's going on. She asks how long he would have to be gone for. 4-6 weeks. Give DEBBY some very intelligent lines, so she's not seen as just a birthing vessel. They should argue. She could even say "I'm not just a bloody birthing vessel". DEBBY is worried about their future and tells him to go back and accept the offer. She says she's been alone before and she can do it again. Baby's not due for another 8 weeks. BB packs up his stuff, including his book collection.

------ SCENE 5 ------ 

(7SP OFFICE, midday)

PG (alone) clearing out his desk, packs up his books, which are a mirror image of BB's books. PG takes a wad of maps and puts them in his briefcase too. BB returns and accepts PG's offer. PG casually tells ZED he's fired and to fuck off. ZED starts to give them trouble but BB goes after him and he runs away "He said fuck off." Need to express that ZED is very mad at hurt and somehow makes it clear he wants revenge at this point, and/or give him more motivation based on additional story events.

(7SP OFFICE, night)

PG dumps petrol (water) from a jerry can all over the 7SP office. We cut to PG's face. He lights a match and tosses it. His face suddenly becomes lit by a flickering orange light.

------ SCENE 6 ------ 

(COMPOUND, night)

PG, BB, and employees are working on building the compound up. They've clearly made a lot of progress and it's almost ready to go. BB asks PG if he can send for DEBBY now. PG says "You can send for her, but if she doesn't have any skills, she'll have to be... community property." CURMUDGEON interjects, explaining: "Breeding stock." (If we have anyone dressed as CURMUDGEON, they can have that line). BB tries to attack PG but his minions stop him. They throw BB out of the compound. BB leaves in anger. Needs a way to get back to HOUSE. Imply or show that he steals PG's car.

------ SCENE 7 ------ 

(HOUSE EXTERIOR, night)

Establishing shot, no actors.

(HOUSE INTERIOR, night)

DEBBY playing the music box on her tummy again. 

RADIO: The Tynong North and Frankston killer always leaves his knife behind, and keeps a trinket he steals from his victim. In lighter news.... Now says a bunch of inane drivel about a cute koala or something.

DEBBY doesn't make it to the last note, so things feel uncomfortable and incomplete. Sound of a door opening. "Brucie?" Some kind of murder scene that doesn't show too much. ZED (not sure if we wanna show his face or have it be implied, do both takes) reaches down, sets down a bloody knife (does he use a knife? why does he set it down?), and takes the music box out of DEBBY's dead hand. DEBBY's hand has the imprint of the music box in bruises and blood in her hand, from squeezing it so tightly (use red pen and fake blood). The camera sees some skin but nothing too racy or gory. We hear ZED walk away and out the broken door. Camera holds on doorway after ZED leaves. It stays there for a while. Long enough for ZED to vanish, and long enough for BB to get home, come into the doorway, and see his wife dead. Takes off hat, reveals mohawk. Implied: BB has to cut baby Steven out of his dead pregnant wife's body (does he use ZED's knife, or does he find one from the kitchen?).

------ SCENE 8 ------ 

(7SP OFFICE, night)

Camera closeup of PG's burning employee list. Similar shot to the one earlier, when it had a closeup of PG's pen. Moving downward, it indicates BB's name: Bruce Barbagallo. Address: BB's address. Notes: Hometown Werrington NSW--nickname "Wez". Screeching violin plays, repeating the motif from the beginning of the film.

------ SCENE 9 (optional) ------ 

(MUNDI MUNDI, sunset)

As the ending credits roll, and after the credits are done, grown FERAL KID, in nicer (but still post-apocalyptic) clothing, with music box in hand, visit the sweeping vista of Mundi Mundi Lookout. He turns the crank and plays the song, either alone, or against the belly of his wife. This time, we hear the last note of Happy Birthday.

ORIGINAL MAD MAX 2 SCRIPT INTRO https://imsdb.com/scripts/Mad-Max-2-The-Road-Warrior.html
------

         Ih. A LINE OF CARS... lh.
          stretches for blocks until it finally reaches
          a gas station.
          An attendant pulls down a sign which reads:
                         $7/GALLON
          and replaces it with another sign:
          AUTHORISED VEHICLES ONLY
          A group of angry motorists gather around, yelling
          and pushing.
          The attendant produces a gun motioning them back...
                         NARRATOR
          for without fuel they were
          nothing. They had built a
          house of straw...
          ii. BUSINESSMEN AT A STOCK EXCHANGE... li.
          are yelling and shoving.
                         BUSINESSMEN
          Sell! Sell! Sell!
          Torn up scrip litters the floor...
          Ij. THE FOYER OF A HUGE CORPORATION lj.
          The company's crest is chiselled on the wall. it
          is accompanied by the words:
          SEVEN SISTERS PETROLEUM
          "Fuelling The World"
          on the floor below, beyond the marble pillars, we see
          the building is abandoned - littered with broken
          furniture and piles of documents.
           DISSOLVE. 4            
          lk. A CORRIDOR. 1k.
          We pass through a door designated:
          CHIEF EXECUTIVE
          At the other end of the imposing room we see a
          businessman clearing out his vast desk. His name is
          PAPPAGALLO. On the wall behind him we see photo-
          graphs and paintings of oil wells and refineries.
          PAPPAGALLO takes a wad of maps and puts them in his
          briefcase, followed by a copy of 'Whole Earth
          Catalogue" and another book. The cover reads:
          TEACH YOURSELF SOLAR ENERGY
          I.l. LIVING ROOM. ii.
          An ANXIOUS FAMILY is gathered in front of a
          television set. A politican addresses the nation.

          emergency is effective
          immediately. Citizens are
          warned...
          The speech is cut short as static fills the screen.
          The family looks up at the lights as they flicker...
