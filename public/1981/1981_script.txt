"1981"

(BLACK SCREEN, CREDITS) Muffled sound of a slow heartbeat. Muffled sound of a music box playing Happy Birthday, sounding like the listener is underwater.
(BB'S HOUSE) 1981 appears in huge font. Cut to PW's pregnant belly, with her hands holding a music box to her tummy and turning it, so we now hear Happy Birthday playing clearly. BB is in bed beside her snoring and TV/radio is also playing in the background. faintly. TV/radio grows louder as PW gets up and prepares breakfast. NYC has just reported another explosion--a FALN bomb is suspected, chilean libertadores, everything I list in the beginning of A-N-D, Government instability, viruses, overpopulation, and scientists haven't come to an agreement yet but some say we could be headed for a new Ice Age. Other radio announcer chimes in with some quip about how good that would feel right now, with this January heat. Unemployment is now 60%, violent crime is up 300%, inflation is now 400%, oil prices have increased by 1000% and prime minister Malcolm Fraser just announced that oil companies have been nationalised. BB is 17. BB wears a hat (or doesn't have a mohawk yet) and his nametag that says "Bruce" is revealed early, to hide the fact that he is Wez. BB, dyed red hair, a rebellious punk but dressed in his mechanic coveralls for work, his patch reads Barbagallo. PW is speaking to him in a low, sexy aussie accent and cuddling him. "Time to get up Brucie." get mic CLOSE to PW's mouth so it sounds the way it would sound to bruce. and says something about BB working late again but he has to get up. PW hands him a bacon egg roll for him to take to work. BB kisses her goodbye and kisses her pregnant belly.

(7SP OFFICE) BB arrives at work. He joins up with NC and CC, also arriving at work, dressed similarly. They have to accommodate NC's wheelchair(?). On their way to work, random people are fighting and random crimes are in progress. CC says something creepy and suggestive about BB's wife. Says she's "toey." Makes some joke about having sex with a pregnant lady means you're kind of having sex with the baby too. BB lunges for him. NC grabs his arm, very strongly and tightly. But BB is strong too, and still tugging, and the camera looks at the wheels of the wheelchair and we see the chair slide sideways a bit. NC says "leave him be, he's so dumb he doesn't even understand the words that come out of his own mouth, he's all talk. he's a virgin, and she'd never go for him. no one would. his mother won't even kiss him. he'd never try anything. especially not with you around." cut to PG's office with nameplate on desk. PG is also listening to the radio, which is now going deeper into the subject of oil nationalisation. PG is going through a list of employees, Closeup of his pen circling some names and crossing out others. PG notices BB has arrived at work and goes out to talk to him while he works on repairing a vehicle. PG explains he's shutting down the company. "I'm gonna burn it all down so there's nothing for them to seize. All of it but one well we're gonna turn into a refinery, so we can produce petrol right on site and use it to barter with." PG invites Bruce to come to compound. Puffs him up with compliments about how he's the best mechanic I've got. BB says no he's not. NC is. Why not take NC? PG says something rude about how they can't have a cripple there slowing everything down. BB asks if PW goes too. PG says BB can't take PW along yet. Can't have dead weight mulling about, getting in the way. Once the compound is built he can send for her. 4 weeks. 6 at the most. It seems quite possible PG is just saying this to trick BB into coming and leaving PW behind. BB says nationalisation isn't a bad thing. He gives some examples of South American "successes." "They're not gonna fire us, they're just gonna take some of the profits out of YOUR wallet. But that oil doesn't belong to you. It belongs to the people of Australia. It belongs to the whole world. It belongs to everyone BUT you." PG insults BB and his wife and friends and says "the vermin have inherited the earth. the world is going to the dogs. You wanna run with the dogs?" PG says I can give you your last paycheck but you and I both know that money's not worth anything anymore, if the bank will even cash it for you. A better life awaits us out in the desert. PG harangues BB to join him, until BB punches him, shot just like MM2 scene with Max at 0:59. PG goes over to invite CC to join him instead.

(BB'S HOUSE) BB goes home and tells PW what's going on. She asks how long he would have to be gone for. 4-6 weeks. PW (give her some very intelligent lines, so she's not seen as just a birthing vessel) is worried about their future and tells him to go back and accept the offer. She says she's been alone before and she can do it again. Baby's not due for another 2 months.

(7SP OFFICE) BB goes back and accepts PG's offer. PG casually tells CC he's fired and to fuck off. CC starts to give them trouble but BB goes after him and he runs away "He said fuck off."

(7SP OFFICE) PG (now alone) dumps petrol (water) from a jerry can all over the 7SP office. We cut to PG's face. He lights a match and tosses it. His face suddenly becomes lit by a flickering orange light.

(COMPOUND) PG, BB, and employees are working on building the place up. They've clearly made a lot of progress and it's almost ready to go. BB asks PG if he can send for PW now. PG says "You can send for her, but if she doesn't have any skills, she'll have to be... well... community property." Curmudgeon interjects, explaining: "Breeding stock." (If we have anyone dressed as curmudgeon, they can have that line). BB tries to attack PG but his minions stop him. They throw BB out of the compound. BB leaves in anger.

...need to clarify how ...

(BLACK SCREEN) Just like at the beginning, muffled sound of a slow heartbeat. And the muffled sound of music box playing Happy Birthday. But the sound is interrupted by the muffled sound of a door being broken down. And the heartbeat DOUBLING in speed. We hear PW make a muffled gasp. We hear muffled footsteps. Then we hear the muffled sounds of a struggle and PW screaming, then the screams die down. Then the heartbeat stops.
(BB'S HOUSE) CC (not sure if we wanna show his face or have it be implied, do both takes) reaches down and takes the music box out of PW's dead hand. PW's hand has the imprint of the music box in bruises and blood in her hand, from squeezing it so tightly (use red pen and fake blood). The camera sees some skin but nothing too racy or gory. We hear CC walk away and out the broken door.

(7SP OFFICE) Camera closeup of PG's burning employee list. Camera continues the downward motion it was making earlier, when it had a closeup of PG's pen. Moving downward, it indicates BB's name. BB's address: Werrington NSW. Notes: nickname "Wez",

IDEAS
(7SP office) 7SP employees are rushing around and packing things up. PG is listening to an Aussie TV news report about the surprise upcoming nationalisation of the oil companies due to price gouging. PG is circling names on a list, including Bruce Barbagallo's name. The mechanics all come in and ask what's going on. PG tells them he needs every vehicle that can possibly run to be up and running ASAP. They argue with him about waiting for the right parts to fix the vehicles up right, but PG says it doesn't matter. All that matters is that they can move. Make it happen by any means necessary. The mechanics begin to go to work, but PG stops Bruce for a private conversation. PG makes BB an offer. He explains that 7SP is no more, and he's taking 40 (10 end up killed on the way) of his best employees out into the wasteland to convert a well into a refinery and a compound where they can all live away from the insanity. PG says BB is his best mechanic and he wants him in the group. BB asks if his buddies can go too. PG says no. PG: "we can't afford to bring any dead weight". PG: "the world is going to the dogs". PG gives him one of his classic speeches to persuade him to come. PG offers bruce the deal. bruce refuses because he wants to take his wife with him. PG harangues him, trying to get him to agree to come out with them. he insults his friends (the other dogs of war) by saying "what do you want to do, stay here and hang out with those punks? those hoodlums? runaways? misfits? gangsters? this scene is reminscent of when PG harangues Max and pushes his buttons until Max punches him. PG harangues Wez until wez punches him. we could shoot it in the same way the Max scene is shot. something about how the world can go to hell, BB's buddies are punks and lowlifes anyway. and we'll go live like kings. and he knows BB needs the money. BB is hesitant and doesn't want to leave his buddies, but he says ok. PG sends him home to pack up everything he needs. 
(BB's house) BB goes home and packs up. He explains that they need to do this because there aren't going to be any more jobs. they have a kid on the way. they need security amidst this chaos. pregnant woman eventually agrees. they head back to 7SP office.
(7SP office) BB arrives and PG says he can't bring pregnant woman. BB: "You said bring everything I need." PG shrugs and goes to grab one of the other mechanic buddies to bring to the compound.
PG sets fire to the office. Maybe include a "This is fine" homage with a burning office. Or just have PG dump petrol everywhere and toss a match behind him. At the end zoom in on PG's list of employees. The names he wanted to take with him are circled, including Bruce's. pan right on burning page, it reads: Hometown: Werrington NSW Notes: Nickname "Wez"
bruce's coworkers (at least those who went off to the compound) must have been mean to him too, not just PG, to make bruce want to be such a dick to them.
Lure the audience into making a judgement about a character, then prove them wrong. Surprise them.
BB steals PG's Trans Am, does not have to be in film, just keep it in mind
Music box that plays happy birthday, and the guy who died with it, is explained. Someone has a birthday coming up.
bruce is powerless, helpless. and it's not in his nature to tolerate that.
those who are invited are told they can't take their partners with them (skills needed, limited resources).
apply whatever filter works to make it look as much as possible like MM2
"I just want to be good." "the good is the enemy of the perfect."
the compound was open to the public, a place to barter for fuel, until it was surrounded by the dogs of war. best way to attack a compound is to starve it of its incoming supplies. especially water. 
BB has to cut baby Steven out of his dead pregnant wife's body
BB too young, GY can't be BB's son or stepson
Pregnant woman sings funny aussie/MM variation of Hush Little Baby
BB's relationship with GY is explained
BB reading Kapital 
PG reading Socialism
PG gives a good and compelling speech about why he wants to take some employees with him and turn a well into a refinery. "we've had wells, and we've had refineries. but we can't safely transport crude oil from one to the other now. so we should find a well in the middle of nowhere and turn it into a refinery."
since actors might be scarce, GY must be not in story, or removable from story--so add him in once the rest is done
music from april
update the TIMELINE when done
