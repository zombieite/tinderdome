------ SCENE 4 ------ 

(HOUSE INTERIOR, midday)

BB tells DEBBY what's going on. She asks how long he would have to be gone for. 4-6 weeks. Give DEBBY some very intelligent lines, so she's not seen as just a birthing vessel. They should argue. She could even say "I'm not just a bloody birthing vessel". DEBBY is worried about their future and tells him to go back and accept the offer. She says she's been alone before and she can do it again. Baby's not due for another 8 weeks. BB packs up his stuff, including his book collection.

------ SCENE 5 ------ 

(7SP OFFICE, midday)

PG (alone) clearing out his desk, packs up his books, which are a mirror image of BB's books. PG takes a wad of maps and puts them in his briefcase too. BB returns and accepts PG's offer. PG says Zed's already taken the position. BB argues with him and  PG tells ZED he's fired and to fuck off. ZED starts to give them trouble but BB goes after him and he runs away "He said fuck off." 

(7SP OFFICE, night)

PG dumps petrol (water) from a jerry can all over the 7SP office. We cut to PG's face. He lights a match and tosses it. His face suddenly becomes lit by a flickering orange light.

------ SCENE 6 ------ 

(COMPOUND, night)

PG, BB, and employees are working on building the compound up. They've clearly made a lot of progress and it's almost ready to go. BB asks PG if he can send for DEBBY now. "She'll have to make herself useful. If she can't help us build, she'll have to be a... natural resource. She's like the oil. She doesn't belong to you. She belongs to everyone." BB tries to attack PG but his minions stop him. They throw BB out of the compound. BB leaves in anger. Needs a way to get back to HOUSE. Imply or show that he steals PG's car.

------ SCENE 7 ------ 

(HOUSE EXTERIOR, night)

Establishing shot, no actors.

(HOUSE INTERIOR, night)

Mirror of the first scene. DEBBY playing the music box on her tummy again. 

RADIO: Police suspect the killer strangles his victims, as no murder weapon has been found. The killer steals a trinket from each of his victims to keep as a souvenir.... Stage three of the national emergency is effective immediately. Citizens are warned (Radio cuts off.) 

DEBBY doesn't make it to the last note, so things feel uncomfortable and incomplete. She gets up to see why the radio cut off. Sound of a door opening. "Brucie?" Some kind of murder scene that doesn't show too much. ZED (not sure if we wanna show his face or have it be implied, do both takes) reaches down, sets down a bloody knife (does he use a knife? why does he set it down?), and takes the music box out of DEBBY's dead hand. DEBBY's hand has the imprint of the music box in bruises and blood in her hand, from squeezing it so tightly (use red pen and fake blood). The camera sees some skin but nothing too racy or gory. We hear ZED walk away and out the broken door. Camera holds on doorway after ZED leaves. It stays there for a while. Long enough for ZED to vanish, and long enough for BB to get home, come into the doorway, and see his wife dead. Takes off hat, reveals mohawk. Implied: BB has to cut baby Steven out of his dead pregnant wife's body (does he use ZED's knife, or does he find one from the kitchen?).

------ SCENE 8 ------ 

(7SP OFFICE, night)

Camera closeup of PG's burning employee list. Similar shot to the one earlier, when it had a closeup of PG's pen. Moving downward, it indicates BB's name: Bruce Barbagallo. Address: BB's address. Notes: Hometown Werrington NSW--nickname "Wez". Screeching violin plays, repeating the motif from the beginning of the film.

------ SCENE 9 (optional) ------ 

(MUNDI MUNDI, sunset)

As the ending credits roll, and after the credits are done, grown FERAL KID, in nicer (but still post-apocalyptic) clothing, with music box in hand, visit the sweeping vista of Mundi Mundi Lookout. He turns the crank and plays the song, either alone, or against the belly of his wife. This time, we hear the last note of Happy Birthday.

FADE IN:
AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK - MIDDAY

"Oil donkey" (AKA pumpjack) pumping. Credits. The title "1981" appears, taking up most of the frame. A few notes of screeching violin plays. These are the same notes we will hear at the end of the film. We hear the notes of Happy Birthday beginning to play on a music box.

CUT TO:
AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK, HOUSE INTERIOR, BEDROOM - MORNING, JANUARY 1981

DEBBY, a punk-rock girl with long brassy blonde hair, sits propped up in bed with a music box on her pregnant tummy. She is turning the crank of the music box, playing Happy Birthday. RADIO ANNOUNCER can be heard faintly in the background. Debby doesn't play the last two notes of the song because she is interrupted by the loud ringing bell of a timer coming from the kitchen. She sets the music box down and leaves the room.

We can now see BRUCE asleep in the same bed. He slept in a work cap and a denim work vest which has been heavily personalised to make it more punk. On one side there is a nametag patch. On the other side there is a patch with the company logo of 7 Sisters Petroleum ("7SP"). Above the 7SP patch Bruce has painted "I DRINK" [7 SISTERS PETROLEUM].

CUT TO:
HOUSE INTERIOR, KITCHEN - MORNING

Debby is preparing breakfast. Closeup of frying pan with bacon. The radio can be heard more clearly now.

RADIO ANNOUNCER
In the United States territory of Puerto Rico, explosions destroyed several Air National Guard aircraft. Police suspect it was yet another act of terrorism in a massive wave of violent rebellion currently sweeping the US. Researchers in South Africa have identified several new cases of a mysterious and deadly immune deficiency illness affecting young men. The researchers suspect that the mens' illnesses are being caused by an unidentified virus. Biologist Paul Ehrlich predicts hundreds of millions will starve before the end of the decade. Ehrlich's predictions are highly respected and he is well on his way to winning a bet with professor Julian Simon. Ehrlich bet Simon that prices of raw materials will continue to skyrocket with no end in sight. Economist Deanna Binns has been invited to address the Australian parliament later this year. Binns believes that Australia should adopt economic policies similar to those of Chile's ("CHILL-eez") reactionary dictatorship. With unemployment and inflation already over ten percent, Pinochet ("PEE-no-shay") style reforms could devastate Australia's economy. Oil prices have more than tripled, and prime minister Fraser ("FRAY-zer") announced this morning that Australia's oil companies will be nationalised and managed by the Australian government.

Debby turns off the radio and brings a bacon and egg roll on a plate to Bruce in the bedroom. 

CUT TO:
BEDROOM

Debby leans over and whispers into Bruce's ear.

DEBBY
Time to get up Brucie.

BRUCE
(Mumbling) 7 Sisters Petroleum. Fuelling the world.

DEBBY
I made you brekkie.

Debby playfully shoves the sandwich into his face.

BRUCE
Could you wrap it up for me? I have to go.

DEBBY
I'll wrap a couple up for Neil and Zed, too. Put on some pants.

Debby returns to the kitchen to wrap up the sandwiches while Bruce remains in the bedroom. The camera reveals Bruce's backside. Despite having slept in his vest and hat, on his bottom half he is wearing only his underwear, and his underwear is merely a g-string that shows off his butt cheeks. Bruce puts on pants and makes a minimal attempt to get ready for work.

INTERCUT:
DEBBY/BRUCE

DEBBY
Did Pappagallo have you working late again?

BRUCE
He's preparing for something big. But he won't say what it is.

DEBBY
Frazer nationalised the oil companies.

BRUCE
It's about bloody time.

DEBBY
Is that good news or bad news?

BRUCE
It worked for Chile (Bruce pronounces it "CHEE-lay").

DEBBY
I mean, are you going to lose your job?

BRUCE
It could go either way. I might be promoted. I might be fired.

CUT TO:
KITCHEN

DEBBY
There are going to be three of us soon.

Bruce emerges from the bedroom and smiles. He embraces Debby. He gives her a peck on the lips and a peck on her pregnant belly.

BRUCE
I'll do whatever it takes. If it weren't for you, I'd tear this whole bloody world to the ground.

Debby hands him three sandwiches wrapped in newspaper, and takes a bite out of the one that was on the plate. Bruce walks out the door. Debby returns to the bedroom to find a human-shaped oil stain on the sheets. She sighs and removes the sheet.

RADIO ANNOUNCER
In local news, the Tynong ("TIE-nong") North and Frankston murders remain unsolved after three more women's bodies were found last month. And speaking of serial killers, now back to the music. This is "I Don't Like Mondays" by the Boomtown Rats. It's a song about Brenda Spencer, a 16-year-old girl who opened fire on a primary school in San Diego.


CUT TO:
7SP FIELD OFFICE, EXTERIOR - MORNING

The 7 Sisters Petroleum field office is a bit run down. Everything looks worn out and there's even some graffiti on the sign by the front door. ZED is bent over working under the hood of a car. Zed has personalised his vest, as Bruce has. The back of Zed's denim vest reads, "I DON'T LIKE MONDAYS EITHER." NEIL, in a wheelchair and also dressed in a denim vest, is working with Zed. Bruce arrives at the office, joining Zed and Neil.

ZED
Have you heard the rumour?

BRUCE
We're being nationalised. 

ZED
No, the other rumour. Pappagallo is bringing everyone into his office. One at a time.

BRUCE
He's firing us. 

ZED
That's not what I heard. I heard he's picking the best of us for a special project. I hope he picks me!

NEIL
You just said he's picking the best. So you know he's not picking you.

Bruce hands sandwiches to both of them. Zed and Neil start eating. Zed talks with his mouth full but Neil is more polite.

ZED
Aw, Debby still cooks for me.

NEIL
She never cooked for you.

ZED
Yes she did. She was my girlfriend before Bruce stole her from me.

NEIL
She went on one date with you.

ZED
One date she'll never forget.

NEIL
One date you'll never forget.

ZED
(To Bruce) You ever strangle her? She likes it when you strangle her.

BRUCE
No she doesn't. And that's why you only got one date.

ZED
She's really toey. Now she's up the duff. You reckon the baby feels it when you're rooting her?

Bruce moves to attack Zed but Neil grabs his arm. Bruce tugs so hard that he pulls Neil's wheelchair sideways.

NEIL
Pay no mind to him. The last woman he was inside was his mother. He's all talk. He'd never try anything with Debby. Especially not with you around.

Neil lets Bruce go. Bruce feigns another attack and Zed flinches. Bruce walks away and begins work on another nearby vehicle. PAPPAGALLO appears. He is a middle-aged businessman wearing a 70s suit and a wide tie.

PAPPAGALLO
Bruce, can I see you in my office?

Neil and Zed make schoolboy sounds, as though making fun of Bruce for being in trouble with the principal.

CUT TO:
7SP FIELD OFFICE, INTERIOR - MORNING

Pappagallo has a nameplate on his desk indicating that he is the CEO of 7 Sisters Petroleum. A photo of oil derricks is mounted on the wall behind him. He is writing on a piece of paper. He is drawing lines through the names of some of his employees, and circling others. We see him circling Bruce's name as Bruce enters. Bruce doesn't sit down and Pappagallo doesn't bother asking him to.

PAPPAGALLO
You've probably heard we're being nationalised.

BRUCE
That oil doesn't belong to you. It belongs to everyone.

PAPPAGALLO
Yes, but it takes the brains of people like me... people like us... to get it out of the ground and turn it into something everyone can use. So a few of us are going to take one of the oil donkeys and build a little refinery around it. We'll have a peaceful community out in the desert while the rest of the world goes to the dogs.

BRUCE
They know the pumpjack is out there. They'll come for you eventually.

PAPPAGALLO
I've already destroyed the records. They'll never find us.

BRUCE
What's this got to do with me?

PAPPAGALLO
I want you to come with us. You're the best mechanic I've got. 

BRUCE
No I'm not. Neil is.

Pappagallo looks out the window at Neil.

PAPPAGALLO
We need someone... with more... mobility.

BRUCE
Can Debby come?

PAPPAGALLO
Once the compound is built you can send for her. Four weeks. Six tops. 

BRUCE
No way.

Bruce walks out the office door. Pappagallo gets up and follows him. 

CUT TO:
7SP FIELD OFFICE, EXTERIOR - MORNING

Bruce goes back to work on the car. Zed runs up to Bruce. Pappagallo joins him.

ZED
What did he offer you?

BRUCE
He's making a new town out in the desert. He wants me to go with him.

ZED
Are you going to go?

BRUCE
I have everything I need right here.

PAPPAGALLO
You don't have a future. I could offer you that. Come with us. We'll live like kings. 

BRUCE
Not without Debby.

PAPPAGALLO
When we're just getting started we can't have dead weight mulling about, getting in the way. Unless you'd allow her to be... community property.

ZED
(Giggling) Breeding stock.

BRUCE
No thanks.

Bruce keeps trying to get his work done as Pappagallo hounds him.

PAPPAGALLO
You think you're happy here? You want to run with the dogs? The punks? The misfits? You're a nobody with nothing to do. And nowhere to go.
 
Bruce has been trying to ignore him but at this point Pappagallo is in his face and going for broke.

PAPPAGALLO
What's so special about Debby? You don't have anyone else in your life? No family? No parents?

Bruce brusquely turns and walks away. His manner suggests he's given up on getting anything done at work today, and he's heading home, possibly never to return. Pappagallo grabs him and stops him from leaving.

PAPPAGALLO
So that's it. You lost your parents. Well you know what? We all lose our parents. If we're lucky enough to live that long.

Bruce angrily shakes Pappagallo off of him, but Pappagallo grabs him again.

PAPPAGALLO
Bruce....

Bruce punches Pappagallo and knocks him over. Zed runs to Pappagallo's aid. Bruce starts walking home. Pappagallo waves to Zed, inviting him to join him in his office. Zed jumps and cheers.
