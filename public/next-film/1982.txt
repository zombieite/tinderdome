DISTANT EAST OF MUNDI MUNDI LOOKOUT - DAY

[OPTIONAL] ZED is driving a big truck, heading west, whistling happy birthday, holding a music box in his hand. He looks over at the passenger seat, but we can't see what's there.

CUT TO:
JUST EAST OF MUNDI MUNDI LOOKOUT - DAY

WEZ is walking west on a desolate highway, carrying a crossbow and a jerry can. He sees MAX up ahead, pushing his black-on-black Ford Falcon toward him, heading east. When Wez gets close, Max notices him, and more importantly, Max notices the can of petrol that Wez is carrying. Max stops pushing and leans on the boot of his car, breathing heavily. Wez walks up to Max.

WEZ
Have you seen a truck come through here?

Max briefly glances over Wez's shoulder into the distance, but we aren't shown what Max is looking at. Then Max looks in the direction of the jerry can. Wez follows his gaze.

WEZ
I can't. This can is all I have left.

Max starts to push his car again, facing forward. Wez starts pushing too, facing backward.

WEZ
In this can is my wife, my child, my house, my car, my bank account.... The driver of that truck took everything from me. He killed my wife and our unborn child.... We were gonna name it Steven, or Stephanie.... When I found her body, her stomach was torn open.

MAX
Maybe someone saved your baby.

Wez moves to the front of the car to help steer while they push.

WEZ
Maybe someone ate my baby.

Wez notices a photo of a woman and child on the centre of Max's steering wheel. 

WEZ
Is that a photo of your family?

Max abruptly gets between Wez and the car. 

MAX
Look. That can for the location of the truck. Have we got a deal or what?

WEZ
The driver of that truck even took the little music box my wife used to play for our child. She'd place it on her belly and turn the crank.

Max starts pushing with an extreme amount of effort, as the road has begun to slope uphill. Wez stares at him, conspicuously not helping.

WEZ
Half. 

Max pauses, his face showing his frustration. He puts a rock under the tire and disarms a booby trap. He opens up the petrol cap. Wez pours a tiny bit in and stops. Max grabs the can and shakes it to verify that Wez indeed put in half. Max is angry to discover that the can had very little fuel in it to begin with. Max hands the can back to Wez.

WEZ
Have you seen the truck?

Max again looks up into the distance behind Wez, this time making it clear that he is looking at something in particular. Wez turns to follow his gaze. We see the truck approaching and hear its horn. Wez's eyes widen. As the truck passes, he fires an arrow into the driver's side door. The truck continues on its way westward. Max gets in the car. Wez jumps into the passenger side. Wez holds up the fuel can.

WEZ
You can have the rest when we catch him.

Max shakes his head. Max gets out so he can throw Wez out of the passenger side, but Wez quickly climbs into the driver's side. Wez successfully gets the car started and drives off. The jerry can falls out of the open passenger side door and onto the road.

CUT TO:
MUNDI MUNDI LOOKOUT - DAY

Wez, in Max's car, catches up to the truck and finds it on the side of the road at Mundi Mundi Lookout. The truck's driver's side door has an arrow in it and is leaking blood. Wez creeps toward the driver's side but then he hears a baby crying. He stops in his tracks, then runs around to the passenger side. He opens the door and finds a newborn child [AUDIO ONLY].

[OPTIONAL] Wez looks up at the truck driver. ZED is smiling, while bloody and dying from the arrow that hit him. He holds up a knife.

[OPTIONAL] ZED
I cut your girl up real good. (Dies).

Wez takes his newborn child and wraps him in some rags.

WEZ
Steven.

Wez carries the child over to the Falcon and places him into the passenger seat. He gets in and tries to start the car, but it is once again out of petrol. Max struts up to the car, carrying the jerry can, and sucker punches Wez. Max opens the door and lets Wez drop onto the ground. Max dumps the rest of the petrol into the Falcon and drops the can onto the ground. Max drives off eastward with the baby still in the passenger seat.

MUNDI MUNDI LOOKOUT - DAY

Wez wakes up.

WEZ
Steven!

Wez stumbles but gets up quickly. He sprints eastward while shouting his child's name.

WEZ
Steven! Steven!

GOLDEN YOUTH is at the side of the road repairing his motorbike. He hears the sound of a baby crying. He looks up in confusion. He finds baby Steven lying in the middle of the empty road. He picks up Steven and gives him some of his water. He looks up to see Wez approaching slowly, breathing heavily and sweating. Wez smiles faintly.
