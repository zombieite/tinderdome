* Feral Kid (FK) attempts to hit a rabbit with a boomerang all afternoon. She finally gets one. We see her eating a tiny chicken wing as night falls.
* FK's face is lit up as the compound's lights come on in the distance. FK is intrigued and walks toward the lights. FK peeks in to see Pappagallo (PG) and friends eating a massive feast, socializing and laughing.
* The next day, FK tries to walk in the front gate. Rouseabout turns her away, tells her, "If you want to join us, you have to make something of value or do something of value. You can't just walk in and expect us to feed you."
* FK digs her way under the compound wall and explores the place.
* Veronica (Captain's Girl) sees FK, asks if she's lost. Says, "You smell like you've been lost a while." She walks FK around the compound but no one claims her. She cleans up FK with some soap and water and tries to dress her up a bit. She lets FK sleep beside her that night.
* Veronica tries to get PG to allow FK into the compound. PG kicks FK out. He says "No kids allowed. Just another mouth to feed."
* Rouseabout fills up the hole that FK dug under the wall.
* FK sits outside compound as others with stuff to barter come and go freely, happily. FK watches and waits for days on end.
* At some point a snake slithers toward PG. A boomerang comes from out of nowhere and slices it in half. PG turns to look at dead snake, then looks up at FK in the distance, still standing outside the gates.
* PG walks up to FK and invites her into the compound.
