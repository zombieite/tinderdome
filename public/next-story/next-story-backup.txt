If you're glancing at the first few pages of this book and trying to figure out if this story is worth reading then screw you. I don't know how to grab your attention. I'm not a writer. I'm just someone who's trying to tell you a bunch of stuff that happened.
I was at work at the Firebird factory in Norwood Ohio. It was Christmas Eve. Yes it was snowing but who cares if the snow was twinkling or whatever. I'm just gonna tell you what happened.
Christmas is a weird time for me because my entire family was killed on Christmas. Then the whole world blew up. I'm over it now. It was a long time ago. The "Big Bang" as I like to call it was all the way back in 1981 and I eventually killed the bloke that did it. If you're thinking about killing my family and blowing up the world then you'd better think twice.
That stuff is all in another book called Heads Will Rock: A chronicle of postapocalyptic mayhem. If you ain't read it yet don't bother. It's really just a marketing brochure for the cars we were selling.
Like I said I was at work at the Firebird factory. We'd reopened the old General Motors assembly plant in Norwood Ohio and we were building the first new cars the world had seen since the apocalypse. Big Bang. Whatever.
I ran the place. Nobody gave me that job. But no one else was doing it so I just took it. The car we started out making was pretty much a Pontiac Firebird but as time went on we improved a heap of things about it and now we called it the Phoenix.
The first cars we made were just piles of old spare parts but once the supply chains came back to life the world was once again casting blocks and stamping steel and molding plastic and engineering new rubber compounds.
People ask me how we did it and they never seem to get it when I say I don't know. I only know the bits and bobs that I did myself. The larger processes involved are things like supply and demand. Price and value and cost. Division of labor and specialization and mass production. Prosperity equals resources plus skills times tools. But the most important thing is innovation. Ideas. This is all economics and economics is not something that any business or government can plan from above. It has to grow from below. You get the soil right and then you stand back and laissez faire. Let It Be. Like the Beatles said. And before you start a Revolution make sure you're not just gonna end up breaking things and making everything worse. Like the Beatles said.
If you think I'm going off on an unrelated tangent then clearly you have read my books before! But not this time loyal reader. Cuz stupid revolutions is exactly what we were dealing with at the Norwood Ohio Firebird Phoenix factory on Christmas Eve.
There were the fascists who called themselves the Hellies. And there were the commies who called themselves the Gillies. They hated each other and they hated us. We'd taken to calling ourselves the Wheelies. We hated both sides and we just wanted to build cool cars.
Let me take that back. We didn't hate them. We just disagreed with them. The fact is they both thought they were saving the world. And we did too. I guess I'll just leave it to you to figure out which one of us was right.

"Can you fly a helicopter?" I asked.
"Sure" Jimmy said. "I'm a Helly."
I looked up at him.
"I mean... I used to be."
"Be whatever you want" I said. "Just don't be it at work. No party colors. No reds. No blues."
"Not even blue jeans?"
"If we take you on as a mechanic they won't stay blue for long. If you wanna wear a color we wear yellow here."
"That sounds like a party color."
"Our party platform consists mainly of the belief that parties should not exist. Come take a look at our helicopter." I brought him outside.
"Why do you need a mechanic that can fly a helicopter?"
"We need a mechanic because we build cars. We need a helicopter pilot because people try to stop us from building cars. We use the helicopter to defend the plant."
"What happened to your last pilot?"
Now he'd hit a nerve. Her name was Dorktown. I'd considered her a friend. Maybe more than a friend but not in the way that you're thinking. I still had the note she'd left behind.
"She left. She didn't say where she was going. I haven't seen her in two years."




And when necessary we killed them. Anyway the Hellies and the Gillies were coming at us from both sides that day and so one of my employees hit the big red button and stopped the line. There was a flashing red light and an alarm. Bullets and bombs and crumbling bricks.

NOTE: this might need to start with a job interview, FB tells new guy to leave his gang colors at the door when he comes in to work. fb asks him if he can fly easy money because his star pilot is AWOL. at the bar later, either he sympathizes with the gillies or he foolishly lets slip a secret to CD: dorktown has been gone for years, and this emboldens the gillies and/or the hellies to attack. problem is DT can't vanish without having time to set up Dorktowntown, and if she needs to vanish for a period of time we can't have everything collapse immediately or else there'd be no need to get her back anymore. so it really only works if she's needed, but not so badly that we can't hang on by a thread without her. still unclear who finds out/how they find out DT is in Perth.

Me and my employees went to war. We used to do fine in these battles because we had a nice M1 Abrams tank we'd stolen from the Gillies and a unique armored Chinook helicopter we'd stolen from the Hellies. Like it really was one-of-a-kind. You can read about it in your history books if you can find any history books. The helicopter was named Easy Money.
The problem was there was only one person left on earth who could fly Easy Money.
"Where's Dorktown?" I shouted.
My factory manager Laura was the one who answered me but her answer didn't contain any useful information. "I don't know" she said. She made sure her 5-year-old kid Lucy ran to the Safe Room. That kid was a little beast though. Give her a couple more years and she'll be leading the rest of us into battle.
"Wait!" Laura shouted. "The Quatman!" She pointed at a flyer on the bulletin board. The Ed Davis Band was playing there tonight and even though they were a bunch of old geezers Dorktown was a sucker for a punk show.
I found my best mechanic Superturbo. He used to be an executioner for the Gillies but he'd come a long way since then. Nowadays he was a pacifist so he wasn't gonna do us any good here.
"Superturbo! Run down to the Quatman and see if you can find Dorktown."
