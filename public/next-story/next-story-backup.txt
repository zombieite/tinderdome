1: Norwood
I don't like reading any more than you do so I ain't gonna waste your time with a bunch of fancy descriptions. I'm just gonna tell you how we flew to the moon. Yeah that's right. Six Apollo missions. And then there was us.
I was running a car factory in Norwood Ohio. I was at work. It was Christmas Eve. It was snowing. Christmas is a weird time for me because my entire family was killed on Christmas. Then the whole world blew up.
But I'm over it. It was 40 years ago and I eventually killed the bloke that started it all. If you're thinking about blowing up the world you'd better think twice. Firebird will come for you and Firebird will put the world back together.
That stuff is all in another book. It's called HEADS WILL ROCK: A chronicle of postapocalyptic mayhem. If you ain't read it don't bother. I got a better story for ya.
Like I said I was at the car factory. We'd reopened the old GM assembly plant and we were building the first new cars the world had seen since the Big Bang. 1982 Pontiac Firebirds. Except it was 2022 and we called them Firebird Phoenixes but you get the idea.
These really were new cars. Sure the first ones we made were just piles of old spare parts but eventually we got the supply chains back together and our suppliers were casting blocks and stamping steel. We even got computers and cameras and movies working again!
2022 was looking more and more like what I'd expected it would look like back when I was a kid. Except for the flying cars and jetpacks. I'm sure we would have had all those things and more if it hadn't been for the Big Bang.
People ask me how we did it and they never seem to get it when I say I don't know. I only know the bits and bobs that I did myself. It's called division of labor and specialization and it's not something that any business or government can plan from above. It has to grow from below. You get the soil right and then you stand back and laissez faire. Let It Be. Like the Beatles said. And be careful that your revolution doesn't end up breaking things and making them worse. Like the Beatles said.
If you think I'm going off on an unrelated tangent then you must've read my books before. But not this time dear reader. Cuz stupid revolutions is exactly what we were fighting that day at the Norwood Firebird Phoenix factory.
On one side we had the fascists who called themselves the Hellies. On the other side we had the commies who called themselves the Gillies. We'd taken to calling ourselves the Wheelies since we hated both sides and we just wanted to build cool cars.
Let me take that back. We didn't hate them. They hated each other and they hated us. We just disagreed with them. And when necessary we killed them. Anyway the Hellies and the Gillies were coming at us from both sides that day and someone hit the button to stop the line. We had a flashing red light and an alarm and all that stuff.
Me and my employees had to go to war again. We used to do fine in these battles because we had a nice M1 Abrams tank we'd stolen from the Gillies and a unique armored Chinook helicopter we'd stolen from the Hellies. Like it was really one-of-a-kind. You can read about it in your history books if you can find any history books. The helicopter was named Easy Money.
