TITLE THAT CLEVERLY WORKS WITH THE ONE-LINE SUMMARY, AND IS SEARCH-ENGINE OPTIMIZED
1981

ONE-LINE SUMMARY OF THE STORY INCLUDING SOME KIND OF "TWIST" OR "HOOK" BUT NOT ITS RESOLUTION. IT SHOULD MAKE YOU WANT TO HEAR THAT RESOLUTION. IT SHOULD MENTION THE MAIN CHARACTERS. THE MAIN CHARACTER(S) SHOULD BE ARCHETYPICAL, LIKEABLE, RELATABLE AND FACED WITH BIG PRIMAL GOALS. THE LESSONS THEY WILL LEARN SHOULD BE SUGGESTED. IT SHOULD BRING TO MIND THE LIKELY TIMEFRAME, LOCATIONS, EVENTS, AND AUDIENCE. TRY ACTUALLY PITCHING IT TO RANDOM PEOPLE.
