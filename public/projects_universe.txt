1979: Whether Mad Max 1 is fictional or nonfictional is where the timelines split. We now have 2 timelines, Tomorrowland and Epoxyclypse. In Tomorrowland, all of the following is fiction, but it really happens in Epoxyclypse.

1981: Chumdumpster (Steven Barbagallo) is sliced from the belly of his dying mother in Broken Hill, NSW Australia to Mohawk Asshole and Debby. Mohawk Asshole works for Pappagallo. Pappagallo makes Mohawk Asshole an offer to come build and occupy the refinery compound. Mohawk Asshole agrees to help at first, but then, Mohawk Asshole's girlfriend is killed due to Pappagallo's negligence. Mohawk Asshole freaks out and is kicked out of the compound. He steals Pappagallo's Stellar Blue 1975 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am and vows vengeance. The events of MM2 happen, but "Wez" (AKA Mohawk Asshole/BG/BB) survives by jumping off the truck at the last second. MM2 exists in both timelines just as MM1 does, and is also nonfiction in Epoxyclypse.

2020/Year 38: Dorktown arrives in the USA and introduces herself to Firebird. Firebird reveals that he made up the idea of swapping timelines, which means in "Tomorrowland," we're all just figments of his imagination. Firebird finally kills Mohawk Asshole.
