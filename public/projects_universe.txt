TIMELINE

1961: Debby is born.

1964: Mohawk Asshole (Brutus Guerrero) is born in Chile to members of the Chilean "Libertadores," a group of Allende supporters.
 
19720801: Firebird is born in New Jersey. 

19760704: Mohawk Asshole's parents are disappeared by Pinochet and DINA (they are among the "desaparecidos"). Mohawk Asshole's aunt and uncle (who are also being pursued around the world by DINA) relocate Mohawk Asshole to Werrington ("Wez"), Sydney, NSW Australia and give him a new Aussie-sounding name, Bruce Barbagallo. 

1979: Whether Mad Max 1 is fictional or nonfictional is where the timelines split. We now have 2 timelines, Tomorrowland and Epoxyclypse. In Tomorrowland, all of the following is fiction, but it really happens in Epoxyclypse.

1981: Mohawk Asshole works for Pappagallo. Pappagallo's company is about to be expropriated and the world is going downhill. Pappagallo makes Mohawk Asshole an offer to come build and occupy the refinery compound. Mohawk Asshole agrees to help, but then, his pregnant girlfriend Debby is killed by Zed. Zed takes Debby's music box and leaves. A passerby (Golden Youth) hears screaming and sees Zed leave the house. Golden Youth stumbles upon the murder scene. He saves the life of Mohawk Asshole's child by slicing him from Debby's belly. That child is Chumdumpster (Steven Barbagallo). When Mohawk Asshole hears about this, he blames Pappagallo because Pappagallo wouldn't let him take Debby with him to the compound. He freaks out and is kicked out of the compound. On the way out he steals Pappagallo's Stellar Blue 1975 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. Mohawk Asshole returns to his house but finds that his house, and most of Broken Hill has burned down due to a fire that Pappagallo started and no one was able to put out. Mohawk Asshole (somehow) discovers that it was the ideas of economist Deanna Binns that drove Pappagallo to abandon his business and burn it down, taking most of Broken Hill with it. Mohawk Asshole remembers that Deanna Binns is to arrive at Syndey for a conference soon and he heads to Sydney to kill her and her family. 

19811225: Mohawk Asshole kills Firebird's family in the Sydney Airport. He accidentally leaves Firebird alive. Firebird steals Mohawk Asshole's (formerly Pappagallo's) Pontiac Firebird. 

1982/Year 0: Mohawk Asshole acquires a motorbike and a boyfriend. He returns to Broken Hill and kills Zed. (More detail needed here for film 1982.) The events of Mad Max 2: Road Warrior happen. "Wez" (AKA Mohawk Asshole/BG/BB) survives by jumping off the truck at the last second. MM2, the film, exists in both timelines, just as MM1 does, and is nonfiction in Epoxyclypse. But MM2 is the last film made until Firebird and friends later reinvent audio/video recording technology. The Big Bang happens, being initiated by the actions of Mohawk Asshole and his fellow revolutionaries around the world. The Big Bang is not just a war. It's a "Black Swan" event, several near-apocalyptic events at once, that lead to the destruction of all goverments and 95% of humanity.

1987/Year 5: Messenger Kid/Scrooloose is born.

19901114/Year 8: Mad Skelli is born.

1999/Year 17: The events in MM3BT happen, but they are never made into a movie in the Epoxyclypse timeline.

2003/Year 21: In the MM3BT flash forward ending, Dorktown can be seen in Messenger Kid/Scrooloose's arms, having been recently born to Messenger Kid/Scrooloose and Savanna in What's-Left-O'Sydney.

2016/Year 34: Mohawk Asshole arrives in the USA looking for Firebird.

2018/Year 36: Firebird loans his car to Deadline, and Mohawk Asshole attacks Deadline hoping to get his car back and find Firebird.

2019/Year 37: Mad Skelli arrives in the USA and begins selling DingoDongles and searching for Firebird. Mad Skelli and Firebird are reunited at the Gathering. Firebird and Mohawk Asshole battle it out in the Cage but Firebird shows mercy and lets Mohawk Asshole live.

2020/Year 38: Dorktown arrives in the USA and introduces herself to Firebird. Firebird reveals that he made up the idea of swapping timelines, which means in "Tomorrowland," we're all just figments of his imagination. Firebird finally kills Mohawk Asshole. Firebird and Dorktown re-open the old Firebird factory in Norwood Ohio.
