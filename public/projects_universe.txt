TIMELINE

1962: Debby is born. 1964: Mohawk Asshole (Brutus Guerrero) is born in Chile to members of the Chilean "Libertadores," a group of Allende supporters. 1972: Firebird is born in New Jersey. 19760704: Mohawk Asshole's parents are disappeared by Pinochet and DINA (they are among the "desaparecidos"). Mohawk Asshole's aunt and uncle (who are also being pursued around the world by DINA) relocate Mohawk Asshole to Werrington ("Wez"), Sydney, NSW Australia and give him a new more Aussie-sounding name, Bruce Barbagallo. 1979: Whether Mad Max 1 is fictional or nonfictional is where the timelines split. We now have 2 timelines, Tomorrowland and Epoxyclypse. In Tomorrowland, the following is all fiction, but it really happens in Epoxyclypse. 1979: The events of MM1 happen. 1981: Chumdumpster (Steven Barbagallo) is born to Mohawk Asshole and Debby. Mohawk Asshole works for Pappagallo. Pappagallo makes Mohawk Asshole an offer to come build and occupy the refinery compound. Mohawk Asshole agrees to help at first, but then, Mohawk Asshole's girlfriend is killed due to Pappagallo's negligence. Mohawk Asshole steals Pappagallo's car and vows vengeance. The events of MM2 happen, but "Wez" (AKA Mohawk Asshole/BG/BB) survives by jumping off the truck at the last second. MM2 exists in both timelines just as MM1 does, and is also nonfiction in Epoxyclypse. 19811225: Mohawk Asshole kills Firebird's family in the Sydney Airport, but accidentally leaves Firebird alive. Firebird steals Mohawk Asshole's (formerly Pappagallo's) car. 1982/Year 0: The Big Bang happens. It's not just a war. It's several apocalyptic events at once, leading to the destruction of all goverments and 95% of humanity. 1987/Year 5: Messenger Kid/Scrooloose is born. 1990/Year 8: MS is born. 1999/Year 17: The events in MM3BT happen, but they are never made into a movie in Epoxyclypse. 2003/Year 21: In the MM3BT flash forward ending, Dorktown can be seen in Messenger Kid/Scrooloose's arms, having been recently born to Messenger Kid/Scrooloose and Savanna Nix in What's-Left-O'Sydney. 2007/Year 25: Firebird meets Mad Skelli and Messenger Kid/Scrooloose. 2015/Year 33: Mohawk Asshole kills Messenger Kid/Scrooloose to get to Firebird. 2016/Year 34: Mohawk Asshole arrives in the USA looking for Firebird. 2018/Year 36: Firebird loans his car to Deadline, and Mohawk Asshole attacks Deadline hoping to get his car back and find Firebird. 2019/Year 37: Mad Skelli arrives in the USA and begins selling DingoDongles and searching for Firebird. 2019/Year 37: Mad Skelli and Firebird are reunited at the Gathering. Firebird and Mohawk Asshole battle it out in the Cage but Firebird shows mercy and lets Mohawk Asshole live. 2020: Dorktown arrives in the USA and introduces herself to Firebird. Firebird reveals that he made up the idea of swapping timelines. It's still quite possible that both timelines are real, but swapping between them is not. Firebird finally kills Mohawk Asshole.
