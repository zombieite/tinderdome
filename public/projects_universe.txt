TIMELINE

1964: MA (Brutus Guerrero) is born in Chile to members of the Chilean "Libertadores," a group of Allende supporters. 1972: FB is born in New Jersey. 19760704: MA's parents are disappeared by Pinochet and DINA (they are among the "desaparecidos"). MA's aunt and uncle (who are also being pursued around the world by DINA) relocate MA to Werrington ("Wez"), Sydney, NSW Australia and give him a new more Aussie-sounding name, Bruce Barbagallo. 1979: Whether Mad Max 1 is fictional or nonfictional is where the timelines split. We now have 2 timelines, Tomorrowland and Epoxyclypse. In Tomorrowland, the following is all fiction, but it really happens in Epoxyclypse. 1979: The events of MM1 happen. 1981: CD is born to MA and his girlfriend. MA works for PG. PG makes MA an offer to come build and occupy the refinery compound seen in MM2. MA agrees to help at first, but then, MA's girlfriend is killed due to PG's negligence. MA steals Papagallo's car and vows vengeance. The events of MM2 happen, but "Wez" (AKA MA/BG/BB) survives by jumping off the truck at the last second. MM2 exists in both timelines just as MM1 does, and is also nonfiction in Epoxyclypse. 19811225: MA kills FB's family in the Sydney Airport, but accidentally leaves FB alive. FB steals MA's (formerly PG's) car. 1982/Year 0: The Big Bang happens. It's not just a war. It's several apocalyptic events at once, leading to the destruction of all goverments and 95% of humanity. 1987/Year 5: MK/SL is born. 1990/Year 8: MS is born. 1999/Year 17: The events in MM3BT happen, but they are never made into a movie in Epoxyclypse. 2003/Year 21: In the MM3BT flash forward ending, DT can be seen in MK/SL's arms, having been recently born to MK/SL and SN in What's-Left-O'Sydney. 2007/Year 25: FB meets MS and MK/SL. 2015/Year 33: MA kills MK to get to FB. 2016/Year 34: MA arrives in the USA looking for FB. 2018/Year 36: FB loans his car to DL, and MA attacks DL hoping to get his car back and find FB. 2019/Year 37: MS arrives in the USA and begins selling DingoDongles and searching for FB. 2019/Year 37: MS and FB are reunited at the Gathering. FB and MA battle it out in the Cage but FB shows mercy and lets MA live. 2020: DT arrives in the USA and introduces herself to FB. FB reveals that he made up the idea of swapping timelines. It's still quite possible both timelines exist, but swapping between them is not something that can happen. FB finally kills MA.
