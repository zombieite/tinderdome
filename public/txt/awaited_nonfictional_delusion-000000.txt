[Firebird]

I remember when life was beautiful and boring. Boredom is underrated. If you're lucky enough to be bored then thank your god. And tell your god I said fuck you.

People call me Firebird. I was born in New Jersey USA but I did most of my growing up in New South Wales Australia.

Mom was a prominent economist. She was known as the "Chicago Gal" cuz she'd studied at the University of Chicago. She spent some time in Chile helping them get their economy off the ground. Dad was a radiologist. In his spare time he made electronic gizmos. Hell he built the goddamn television we watched every night.

When I was a kid mom was invited to speak at a political conference in Australia. Dad had just lost his job so we all tagged along. Mom took some time off to go scuba diving with dad while me and my little sister sat around bored. 

The 70s were crazy. In New York City between 1969 and 1970 a bomb went off every other day. The terrorist group FALN set off 100 bombs in New York and Chicago. A bloke in an office building found a purse containing a bomb with 12 seconds left on the clock. He shouted "there's a bomb in here" or something and 50 people evacuated. 50 people in 12 seconds. Everyone was just expecting bombs to go off at any moment I guess. Hijackings were so common that they seriously considered building a Fake Cuba in Florida so planes could fly there when they got hijacked. There was an oil crisis and a hostage crisis and the Cold War. 

Where I come from the 80s were even crazier.

Those crisises were all over the news at the Sydney airport when we were waiting to fly home. Everyone was stressed the fuck out. My sister was screaming that she was hungry. 

Dad had this cool self-winding dive watch. I asked if I could try it on and he let me.

Then I got bored with that so I reached in my pocket and whipped out my favorite Hot Wheels car. It was a 1977 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am just like the Bandit drove. I was sick of listening to my sister scream so I told her to shut up. 

Mom got mad and grabbed the Hot Wheels out of my hand. She made me tell my sister I was sorry. Then she gave me some shrapnel and told me to go buy my sister some cookies. 

"Then can I have my Hot Wheels back?" I asked.

"Attachment leads to suffering" she said.

I went to the newsstand and grabbed some Tim Tams. The bloke pushed some buttons on his cash register.
 
It was at that point that my life became ugly and interesting.
  
We call it the Big Bang but it wasn't a big bang for everyone. It wasn't one single thing that happened. There were big bangs. There were little bangs. Hell froze over and heaven got too hot. Depends who you ask. Depends where you are when you're asking. For me it was just a little bang but it was big enough.

The cash register bell rang and the drawer opened. Then KABOOM. I saw my Hot Wheels Firebird go racing across the floor. 

The cashier had a piece of a chair stuck in his face. I grabbed the Tim Tams and ran.

There was smoke and fire everywhere. People were running in every direction but I followed that Hot Wheels car right out the exit door to the sidewalk where the cars and taxis were waiting. I bent over and picked it up. 

An asshole with a mohawk slammed into me and we both fell to the ground. He was pissed. He had a big fucking gun which he pointed at my brain. But a bunch of cops ran up and jumped on him and fucked him up.

There was chaos everywhere except for one thing. It was like the universe was apologizing to me because sitting right there before my eyes was a real life Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. Its engine was running. The driver's door was open. The radio was playing AC/DC's Back in Black. Ok I made that part up. Really it was Close to You by The Carpenters. I hate that song.

I was too young to have my license but I knew how to drive and I knew luck was preparation plus opportunity.

I took a look back at Mohawk Asshole. Cops were beating on him. He was fucked up in handcuffs.

He shouted "Little Shit! That's my car!"

I shouted "Attachment leads to suffering" and climbed into my new car! Hell yeah the price was right. Johnny Olson. Bob Barker motherfucker.

I ripped open them Tim Tams and ate em all up as I drove away.

I found a place to pull off and watch the world burn. I looked in the glove compartment of my new badass car and found a pistol. Nice. Then I checked the trunk.

Pistols. Rifles. Shotguns. Revolvers. Semiautomatics. Machine guns. Heaps of ammo. I didn't know what all of those words meant back then but I'd picked em up through the years as I learned how to use all them badass terrorist guns. Having them guns helped a lot cuz I was just a kid and I had to raise myself in the apocalypse.

Since we'd pushed the reset button on the whole world some of us called it Year Zero. In Year Zero I was an American kid stuck in Australia.

Things were bad for a while. People bumped off people for fun or cuz they wanted to eat em. I didn't bump off too many people and I didn't eat anybody but I would've if I'd had to. As someone once said "Grub first then ethics."

Mostly I read a lot of books. Economics and electronics. I was gonna be one of them clever cunts who creates wealth by inventing shit. Not one of them assholes who gets their shrapnel by taking it out of other people's pockets. I've grabbed plenty of shit in my time but it's never been my preferred way of life. 	

I'm probably not telling this story right cuz I'm supposed to be making you like me. I probably sound like I didn't care that my family got blown to bits. If I could tell this story in the voice of that little kid back then I might tell it differently. We see who we were through the eyes of who we've become.

My mom thought I was perfect and she wanted nothing more than for me to be happy. She was wrong, but she got what she wanted.

Nowadays I don't give a fuck about anything. I had lots of good memories back then but that's all gone.

Now I can't remember. Or maybe I just don't.

Things changed that day and I became someone else. Well one of me did anyway. There's another version of me who might be the nice guy you were hoping to meet. But really he ain't so nice neither.
