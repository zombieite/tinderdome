[Firebird]

The Gathering had become known as the place we come to find thems we're looking for and thems we've lost. Didn't matter whether you were looking for love or a friend you haven't met yet or an enemy you haven't battled yet or someone you knew once and lost. Without phones or reliable mail service we needed a designated meeting place. That's the Gathering.

Nowadays pretty much everyone in the world knew about the Gathering. There were lots of local gatherings too. But if the person you were looking for might have ended up anywhere in the world then your best hope was to look for them at the biggest gathering in the world. The Gathering in Damnation Valley California.

They'd held a Gathering every year since Year Zero. I hadn't been to all of them of course. But now that I was living in the USA I'd been attending them every year.

John knew I'd be at this year's Gathering and I knew John would be at this year's Wasteland Weekend. We planned to trade places on purpose for the first time.

Since the Cannibal Run I'd invested all of my money and time into hand-building ten more of my computers to sell at the Gathering. I could fit six in the back seat and four in the trunk but I wouldn't call them "portable" yet.

I'd decided to call my computer the Firebuddy. It should've been easy to sell a box that makes money and friends. But the Firebuddy would only really be useful to someone if lots of other people had them too. I was going to have to advertise.

I decided to go see the cunt that ran the Gathering's newspaper. I pulled up in front of his tiny office in my rumbling V8.

He popped his head out to take a look. "Nice jalopy!" he said.

I introduced myself. "Firebird."

"Yes it is."

"So am I. Who are you?"

"Deadline."

"How many eyeballs does this paper reach?" I asked.

"Eight thousand" he said absently. Still gawking at my car.

I did the math. "That's over four thousand people."

I tried to pitch the idea of him doing an article on the Firebuddy. I ended up selling him a Firebuddy instead. Nine to go.

He wasn't gonna write an article about it until he saw what the thing could do. He wasn't gonna see what the thing could do until I'd sold a heap of them and he could use it to communicate and connect with people.

He said he'd be happy to sell me an ad. But I'd gone all in on building these fancy high tech machines and I couldn't afford an ad. I had nothing left to offer.

Except.

I was 100% sure the Firebuddy could change the world. Especially now that John had turbocharged the thing. The question was would other people realize that too? Was I willing to risk everything?

The reward was worth the risk.

No way I was gonna sell my car. But what I would do was bet my car.

I told Deadline he could have my car if he gave me an ad in every paper he published from now until forever. But if he ever wanted to publish a story about the Firebuddy he'd have to give me the car back first.

Today I was small enough to need advertising. Tomorrow I'd be big enough to be news.

We shook on it. I handed him the keys.

I wrote down the ad copy:


    MAKE MONEY
    FIND LOVE
    TRUST THE ALGORITHM
    GET YOUR FIREBUDDY TODAY


Deadline got a kick out of it.

"Say buddy I can tell you're an idea man" he said. "I've got some ideas of my own see? Let me show you something."

He took me through his tiny office and into an even tinier workshop behind it. There was a big mess of wires on the bench connecting a small vertically mounted square to a red light bulb on the table. He flipped a switch and the red light came on. He grabbed a flashlight and told me to close the door.

When I closed the door the red light went off. This was a windowless room. It was dark and I had no idea what was about to happen.

He turned on the flashlight. The red light came on again.

I opened the door. "That's cool man."

That night I slept under the stars on top of a pile of Firebuddies and dreamed of wealth beyond my... wildest dreams. I dunno. I'm not a writer. I'm just a cunt who's trying to tell you a bunch of stuff that happened.



I'd only sold five of them. I was fucked.

Or at least I was fucked until I figured out what to do with the other five.

When John and I traded places I researched the social networking accounts of our five customers' doppelgangers to see if they had friends or spouses or whatever in Tomorrowland that they hadn't yet met in Epoxyclypse.

When I came back I compared their Tomorrowland friends lists to their Epoxyclypse friends lists. For each of them I found someone in attendance at the Gathering who they'd never met before but who I was sure they'd be friends with in Epoxyclypse because they were friends with them in Tomorrowland. I gave each of their future friends one of the remaining Firebuddies for free. That way when they signed up for You Are Awaited they'd be sure to meet people they liked even though the social network consisted of just ten people. Of course I made it look like there were more than ten people on there by adding a heap of fake users.

At every event like the Gathering or Cannibal Run or whatever I would run the You Are Awaited program that matched up everyone to their future friends. They'd go find each other during the event and shake hands or fuck or whatever. Right now we had a labor-intensive process that required timeline swapping but eventually I'd get around to actually writing the "Algorithm" that would match people up.

The plan worked.

They all got in touch and they all hit it off. I had five pairs of happy people that were shouting from the rooftops about the miracle that was the Firebuddy. "Trust the Algorithm" they said. I'd accidentally started a cult.

People were throwing money at me. I frantically took orders and started putting together a gang of clever cunts that could mass produce Firebuddies. I bought a building in the middle of nowhere to use as a factory.

At that point if I'd had a door Deadline would have knocked it down to get an interview. He dropped off my car and gave me back the keys. He'd even washed the thing. The guy was a class act.

The interview went off the rails when John and I accidentally switched places but that only served to generate more buzz. Everyone wanted to know more about the mad genius named Firebird and his magical Firebuddy.



I stopped in to pick up a copy of Deadline's paper with my interview in it. I was gonna take the piss out of him about the thousand miles he somehow managed to put on my car.

But Deadline was gone. His door was open and his office was trashed.

I was greeted by the Swede instead.

"Howdy mate good to see you again!" I said.

"Hey John what's going on? How'd it go?"

"I'm Firebird. Or at least right now I am. We haven't spoken since the Cannibal Run."

Swede probably thought I was crazy but he didn't seem to mind. "Firebird again eh? Ok then. Maybe you can help us. Deadline's gone missing."

This was not good news. I looked around his office. There were "clues" all over. The place had more red herrings than a fish market. An unpublished article about the sex practices of a local tribe. Drawings and notes connected nonsensically by strings on a bulletin board. A Twinkie on a chair.

Swede explained that he was in charge of the Wasteland Communication Corporation. He was Deadline's boss. They'd received a series of threats to Deadline's life.

People don't threaten to do shit. They just do it. People don't get murdered with four thousand people standing around and nobody seeing nothing.

There were rumors that Deadline been looking into election fraud. Rumors he'd been investigating a corrupt casino. Rumors he'd been kidnapped and brainwashed. Rumors he was time traveling. 

It all sounded like a bunch of bullshit to me. I figured he was alive but I had no clue where to look for him. Ok I had clues but they were super shitty ones. None of it made any sense but I promised Swede I'd do what I could.

Deadline had been last seen at the Civil Defense outpost. I asked Civil Defense about Deadline and they said they'd seen him. He'd mentioned he was going to do a story on the Cult Of Catmeat.

The Cult Of Catmeat was a bunch of idiots who worshipped a cat. Their leader was called Grotch. I was instructed that when it came time to use a pronoun the one that was to be used with Grotch was "it." Catmeat's pronoun was supposed to be the capitalized "He" but I'm gonna take my chances ignoring that one cuz I don't capitalize anything to do with god or government.

I found Grotch and a bunch of its followers in an abandoned christian church which was now looking more like a satanic one. I sat down in back and watched their antics.

Grotch had on a three foot tall punk rock pope hat that was all black. The altar of the Cult Of Catmeat was covered with stuffed cats. I hoped they were all toys and not actual dead cats but I didn't look too closely. Catmeat himself was there lying in a cardboard box and paying no attention to his adoring minions. The cult members were lined up to receive their communion or baptism or whatever and Grotch was spitting blood or wine or something into each of their faces.

When the bullshit was over I introduced myself to Grotch and told it I was looking for a cunt named Deadline who owed me money.

Grotch spoke slowly like it assumed I'd be hanging on its every word. "He interviewed several of us at the Gathering. Being a good journalist he participated in our ceremony."

"He let you spit on him."

"Baptize him. Yes. Then a man with a mohawk appeared and stabbed him. Deadline is one of us now. So we threw the evil man out and healed Deadline."

"Did the asshole with the mohawk say anything?"

"Yes. He said that he wanted his car back."
