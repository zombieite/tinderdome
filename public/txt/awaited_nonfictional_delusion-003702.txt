CHAPTER 8
YEAR 37, MONTH 02
NARRATOR: JOHN

Mohawk A**hole had me in a chokehold. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't move.

I lurched up out of bed with my heart pounding. I thought I was having a heart attack. I couldn't tell which timeline I was in. I was sure Mohawk A**hole was there in the dark somewhere.

I grabbed my phone. The presence of the phone should have reassured me I was home in Tomorrowland, but my sleep-addled brain didn't believe it. I took the phone outside, started to dial 911, and held my thumb over the send button.

I sat out there for an hour before I finally felt normal again.

I'd had some fun trading places with Firebird, but I'd had some terrifying moments as well. I didn't want to spend a lot of time in Epoxyclypse. I both loved it and hated it.

I wasn't just having nightmares. I was also having panic attacks. The ability to hop between worlds scared the heck out of me. To ensure that we would cross over, we had to agree to meet at very specific places and times. If we were off a bit, we wouldn't swap. Other times, we'd inadvertently cross paths, and find ourselves thrown into unfamiliar situations. I don't even want to imagine what would happen if I were stranded in his timeline.

Visiting Epoxyclypse had been an adventure. But adventures involve facing things you're not prepared for and taking risks. I generally preferred to be prepared and reduce risk as much as possible.

It takes a certain kind of magical, irrational person to risk everything. I'm not that kind of person.

Imagine risking everything to start a business, like Firebird did. Most businesses fail. Yet serial entrepreneurs exist. They fail, and fail again. Some eventually succeed. Others spend their entire lives failing. No one would do it if it weren't for the ever-so-slight possibility that they might strike it rich someday.

I just wanted to show up at my job every day, get paid, go home, and take lots of vacations. I was on my way to a comfortable retirement and I didn't want to do anything to mess that up.

Some of my fears were justified. In Epoxyclypse the risk of being attacked, or killed, was much greater. But maybe I needed to take more risks. The risk of our business ventures failing was much lower. The ideas had already been proven to work.

I could have stopped visiting Epoxyclypse. But the idea of saving the world, and getting rich doing it, was intoxicating.

It was quite possible that Firebird and I were the first people in history to discover, and gain control over, the ability to move between timelines. How could we let that go to waste?



The Mad Max fortieth anniversary celebration in Australia was coming up. I'd never been on an international journey. This would be my great pilgrimage. My trip to where it all began. Where it all ended.

Several people started an online discussion about the possibility of making a short film while we were out there. We'd be visiting Mad Max filming locations in Melbourne, Clunes, Silverton, and Broken Hill. We'd have our outfits and cars. All we needed was a script and a director.

My hands were shaking with excitement as I typed. "I'll write the script and direct it."

Firebird had a pile of stories about all the crazy stuff that had happened to him in Epoxyclypse. I decided to use the story about running the roadblock, and meeting Mad Skelli, as inspiration for the script. I'd been involved with writing and cameras all my life, but this would be my first scripted narrative film.

My excitement turned to fear when I realized who I had to cast.

I would love to have cast Mad Skelli's counterpart in Tomorrowland. But Firebird and I had never asked her real name. And she was a postwar, which meant she was born after the timelines split. It's quite possible that because of the war, she had never even existed in Tomorrowland. It's probably for the best. It would have been a tough pickup line. "Have we met before, in another timeline?"

No, not Skelli.

Mohawk A**hole. Bruce Barbagallo.

I found him online. He was a tattoo artist living in South Australia.

It wouldn't be too long of a trek for him to come out to Broken Hill. And everyone wants to be a movie star. He probably grew up watching the Mad Max films, as I had. I could only imagine what it must have been like to have grown up with them as an Australian kid.

It was quite possible Bruce really was the type of person Firebird saw him as. But he wasn't in prison, he hadn't killed my parents, and he hadn't blown up any airports. In Tomorrowland, he seemed like a regular, cool guy.

I went back and forth over it in my head. I was scared, but I didn't want to pass up this bizarre opportunity to see firsthand what a difference this timeline had made on him. It would be a perfect test of nature vs. nurture. I wanted to meet him. But I also knew, for a fact, that some part of him was quite capable of killing me and my family in cold blood.

Oh, wait. I was going to meet him either way. It said so right on his profile.

He was already planning to attend the fortieth anniversary.



I got my visa online. As long as I had my Arizona driver's license, I'd be able to drive in Australia. On the left side of the road. It seemed a little crazy that they would trust me to do that. I looked forward to the challenge. I reserved flights, hotels, and a rental car. Or should I say, "hire car."

I hate flying, but I found a way to tolerate it. I pretended that I lived on the airplane. I accepted that I would never get off the airplane. Then it came as a pleasant surprise when I felt the airplane landing.

At the airport, I was met by a couple of friends I'd met online who'd be helping me make my short film. Driving on the left side wasn't too hard, but the first clockwise roundabout I encountered caused my brain to shut down. I had to pull over and ask my friends what to do. And I kept turning on the wipers when I wanted to activate the turn signals. Or should I say, "indicators."

We visited the Mad Max filming locations at the Melbourne University car park and the pumping station. Then, we went to Clunes, where we visited the train station and Fraser Street. We stayed in Clunes that night. The celebration would begin the next day.

When morning came, replicas of Mad Max motorcycles and cars started filling the streets. I'd never even seen a Ford Falcon XB in person until that moment.

Then I saw Bruce. He wasn't just in attendance. He was a part of the event. He was riding on the back of a tow truck, looking and acting like Wez from Road Warrior.

Including the red mohawk.

I was afraid that, when he saw me, he would experience some sort of interdimensional flash of recognition.

As the truck passed by he looked at me and snarled.

Then he looked away.

The next stop on our journey was Silverton, where we'd be shooting the film. I introduced myself to the people who'd volunteered to act in my little movie. Everyone's outfits looked tip-top. They even did up the hostel we stayed at to look like Exotic Travels.

I introduced myself to Bruce last.

Bruce had brought his tattooing equipment with him. He was setting it up. "Here for a tattoo?" he asked.

"Uh, yeah!"

It was not like me to be so spontaneous about such a permanent commitment, but lately, I'd been starting to accept the fact that my body and my life were only temporary things. No commitment is truly permanent, because nothing is permanent. And taking risks, breaking rules, and getting out of my comfort zone was beginning to lead to great rewards.

I decided on a Firebird symbol on the back of my neck.

As Bruce worked on my tattoo, we got to know each other. I told him about my experiences at Wasteland Weekend. Most of my experiences. I don't usually tell people that I cross into another timeline. But I did tell him how much it really was like entering a different world.

He was fascinated. "I might never want to leave," he said.

"Would you visit another world like that, if you could? Even if there were a chance you'd get stuck there, or killed?"

"Life's an adventure mate," he said. "F*** yeah I would."

It was clear he wasn't a violent person but he'd had a rough life. Bruce and Firebird had something surprising in common. Bruce's parents had also been killed when he was a child. It wasn't too surprising that Firebird's parents were killed. It was the apocalypse. But Bruce said his parents had been killed by fascists before the apocalypse had even happened. Firebird is right. The seventies were crazy.

Bruce was a socialist, which I sympathized with to an extent. I didn't believe in having the proletariat seize the means of production. Like Firebird, I believed in the power of the market, at least when it came to providing luxuries. But when it came to necessities like health care and education, Bruce and I agreed that the government should either provide those things itself, or at least pay for them.

When my tattoo was complete, I asked him to be in my film. He said yes. He was downright enthusiastic about it.

Then I had to ask him something else. "Did you ever own a Pontiac Firebird Trans Am?"

"How did you know? Yeah. There was a CEO of an oil company who lived in my town. He was always driving this gorgeous Trans Am. I talked to him about it a few times. He'd imported it from the states. I saved up for years, hoping to one day get one just like it. One day the bloke put it up for sale. The sign wasn't on that car five minutes. I had it for a few years, then I lost my job and had to sell it. It was a '75. Dark blue, with a light blue bird on the hood. Two-tone red and white interior."

"Special ordered in red, white, and blue for the American Bicentennial."

"Yeah! So the guy could drive it in parades! How'd you know?"

"You told that story to whoever you sold it to, and they passed that story down to me. I'm the current owner of that car."



The February heat was almost unbearable, but we managed to shoot our short film. We got several takes, from several cameras, for every scene.

I didn't have a storyboard in mind ahead of time. We just acted out the script, and I let the camera operators use their own creativity. When I wasn't performing, I was operating one of the cameras. We did our best to stay out of each others' shots. There was an immense amount of improvisation, distributed intelligence, and spontaneous synergy.

I couldn't believe people were following my instructions and letting me drive their cars. I didn't understand why everyone was being so kind, especially considering no one was getting paid for any of this. Everyone remembered their lines except me. Yes, I forgot the lines that I had written. And I was by far the worst actor.

When shooting was complete, I threw away the paper copies of the script. Bruce rescued one from the trash and asked me to autograph it.

That night, when the sun went down at Mundi Mundi Lookout, I saw more stars than I'd ever seen before. There wasn't a single airplane in the sky. Orion was upside down, doing cartwheels. I was, too.



When I returned home, I edited the film over the next few weeks. I planned to release it at the Wasteland Film Festival, which is held on-site during Wasteland Weekend.

Writing and directing had been so much fun that I didn't want it to end. So I decided to begin a crowdfunding campaign to make Firebird's life into a movie. I'd promote it as an old-school film with real stunts, real storytelling, and no CGI.

I asked myself how much money it would take to make me decide to quit my job and work on my movie full-time. I knew it would take a lot. I was happy at my job. I didn't like taking risks like this. But if we got enough buy-in from the wastelander community, I'd do it.

Most people never get a chance to do something awesome. Of those who get a chance, most turn it down. I promised myself that if I got this chance, I wouldn't turn it down.

How much money would it take?

I gave it some thought. I decided. It would take $500,000.

I'd quit my job for a movie budget of half a million dollars. It sounds like a lot, but it wasn't like I'd be keeping that money. Sure, I'd use some of it for my own food and lodging and stuff, but the rest would go toward paying everyone else and making the film awesome.

To hit a fundraising goal of that size, I'd have to go viral.

To go viral, I'd need a gimmick.

Like Firebird, I'd put my car on the line. But I was going to raise the stakes.

I added some text to the credits:

I had no idea how or why my car would be destroyed in the movie, but I figured destroying my car would make for a great ending.

I keep my promises. If we hit that number, I'd quit my job. If we hit that number, I'd crash my car.

Submitting this film to the Wasteland Film Festival might be the most significant button click of my life. I hovered over the button for a moment.

Click.

This would not help with my panic attacks. But screw it. If I got that money, I'd make my movie, or die trying.
