Mohawk Asshole was here in the USA. John and Mohawk Asshole were best mates. John's best mate killed my family and was trying to kill me. And John chased my girlfriend away. Good thing John was gonna make me a billion dollars or I would have swapped places with him just so I could kill myself.

Deadline was missing too but I had a theory about that.

I was attending the Cannibal Run again this year. What? You expected me to feel guilty about what happened last year? We do what we do. We learn from it or we don't.

No way I was entering this year's race. Why do you keep asking me that? I'm just fucking with you. I have no idea what you're asking me. I just know that dumb fucks like you like to watch cunts like me suffer and that's why you're reading this. But I'm not gonna give you that pleasure. I'm gonna be rich.

Me and my employees were selling dozens of Firebuddies every month now. I wasn't a billionaire yet but after this year's Gathering I'd be well on my way.

Or I thought I would be until I noticed a young punk wearing a computer on her arm. It wasn't some vintage piece neither. This was something new I'd never seen before. She was walking around and fiddling with it nonstop. I stopped her and asked what it was. 

"Dingodongle" she said nonchalantly while fiddling.

I asked what she was doing with it.

"Fuck off." She took off running for cover. Then she peeked out and pointed her arm at some bloke. He had on a Dingdong too and it made a noise and flashed. He fell to the ground.

I ran to him. I thought maybe he was dead. "Are you ok?" I asked. 

I reached down to grab his Dingdong. He pulled his arm away and got up. "Yeah dude it's just a game" he said.

He explained that the screen on his arm had a map which showed where other Dingdong users were. You could point your arm at them and their Dingdong would recognize whether you'd hit em or not. Other users showed up on the screen as monsters instead of people. The graphics were amazing.

It was like you were there in the trenches watching the blood splatter as you bumped off Nazi aliens.

Written right there on the side of the thing were the words "Dingodongle. Made in Australia."

Goddammit Skelli.

"Can it do anything else?" I asked. 

"Yeah all kinds of stuff. Peer-to-peer networking. You can send people messages anywhere in the world. Access your You Are Awaited account. Pretty much everything."

I liked that he mentioned my social network but I wasn't making any money off of that. It existed solely to give people a reason to buy Firebuddies. Speaking of that....

"Why didn't you get a Firebuddy?" I asked.

"Games. Dingodongle's got like 50 different games man."

I looked around the streets of Uranium Springs. I counted two people with Firebuddies and 12 with Dingdongs. Dingodongles. Whatever.








Deadline spotted TAKING PICTURES of the race but i couldn't stop because i was in the race

Fuck maybe I do need cash after all. We gotta fill our back orders, fast. Enters the race again.
