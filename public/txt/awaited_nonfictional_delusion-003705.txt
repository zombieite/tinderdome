[Firebird]

Mohawk Asshole was in the USA. John and Mohawk Asshole were best mates. John's best mate killed my family and was trying to kill me. John chased my girlfriend away. Deadline was missing.

I had a theory about that last one though.

Good thing John was gonna make me a billion dollars or I would have swapped places with him just so I could kill myself.

I was attending the Cannibal Run again this year. What? You expected me to feel guilty about what happened last year? We do what we do. We learn from it or we don't.

No way I was entering this year's race. Why do you keep asking me that? I'm just fucking with you. I have no idea what you're asking me. I just know that dumb fucks like you like to watch cunts like me suffer and that's why you're reading this. But I'm not gonna give you that pleasure. I'm gonna be rich. I don't need the money this time.

My little factory was making three Firebuddies a day. I had back orders for months. I wasn't a billionaire yet but after this year's Gathering I'd be well on my way.

Or I thought I would be until I noticed a young punk wearing a computer on her arm. It wasn't some vintage piece neither. It was something new I'd never seen before. She was walking around and fiddling with it nonstop. I stopped her and asked what it was. 

"Dingodongle" she said nonchalantly while fiddling.

I asked what she was doing with it.

"Fuck off." She took off running for cover. Then she peeked out and pointed her arm at some bloke. He had on a Dingdong too and it made a noise and flashed. He fell to the ground.

I ran to him. I thought maybe he was dead. "Are you ok?" I asked. 

I reached down to grab his Dingdong. He pulled his arm away and got up. "Yeah dude it's just a game" he said.

He explained that the screen on his arm had a map which showed where other Dingdong users were. You could point your arm at them to shoot and their Dingdong would recognize whether you'd hit em or not. Some users showed up on the screen as people, some showed up as monsters. The graphics were amazing.

"What's the game called?"

"Alien Guzzaline Wars."

It said right there on the side "Dingodongle. MS Industries, O'Sydney, Australia."

Goddammit Skelli was sexy. I now had a competitor.

"Can it do anything else?" I asked. 

"Yeah all kinds of stuff. Mesh networking. Send people messages anywhere in the world. Access your You Are Awaited account. Pretty much everything."

I liked that he mentioned my social network but I wasn't making any money off of that. It existed solely to give people a reason to buy Firebuddies. Speaking of that....

"Why didn't you get a Firebuddy?" I asked.

"That thing doesn't have any games" he said. "Dingodongle's got like 50 different games man."

I looked around the streets of Uranium Springs. I counted two people with Firebuddies and 12 with Dingdongs. Dingodongles. Whatever.

Guess I'd have to write some games. And expand my production capacity. The former would take time. The latter would take money.

Last year's champion would return after all.



The rules of the Cannibal Run say you can back out at any time before you're at the starting line. I'm telling you that because I was already at the starting line when I'm pretty damn sure I saw Deadline.

The cunt was shooting pictures of the race with a camera the likes of which I'd never seen. The camera was big like an old large format camera but it had a bunch of wires and stuff coming out of it too. I couldn't see the bloke's face too well because he was behind this giant camera thing.

When people take pictures in Epoxyclypse it's a usually a big deal. Not just because you gotta process and print them yourself. It usually involves making your own cameras and emulsions too. It's a very time-consuming and expensive process.

This bloke was pointing and clicking and pointing and clicking and I didn't see any boxes or black bags to keep the light off of the emulsions.

I was so caught off guard by this that I missed the start flag.

The other cars took off and left me in a cloud of dust. I spun up the 455 but not enough. I popped the clutch and stalled it.

All I had to do was not come in last and I was already failing at that.
