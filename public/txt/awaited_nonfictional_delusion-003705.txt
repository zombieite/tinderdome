[Firebird]

Mohawk Asshole was in the USA. John and Mohawk Asshole were best mates. John's best mate killed my family and was trying to kill me. John chased my girlfriend away.

Good thing John was gonna make me a billion dollars or I would have swapped places with him just so I could slit my throat.

And Deadline was missing.

I had a theory about that one. All those stupid non-clues were just distractions. Deadline wasn't dead but someone didn't want him found. Mohawk Asshole had come looking for my car. He saw Deadline driving it so he stabbed Deadline. So maybe Deadline had gone into hiding. Maybe someone was protecting him.

But people stab each other all the time. What was so important about Deadline that he had to be protected? Who would go to such great lengths to hide him and keep him hidden?

Swede had said something weird to me before he told me Deadline was missing. He'd called me John and asked me how things went.

Was the Wasteland Communication Corporation involved? Was John involved?

John and I had traded places during the interview with Deadline and Deadline had vanished shortly thereafter. Swede knew about my strange ability since he'd seen it firsthand. I guess one way to make sure no one knew where someone was hiding would be to hire someone from another timeline to hide the bloke and not tell anyone where you put him. Mohawk Asshole could torture anyone he wanted and no one would tell him where Deadline was because no one would know.

It was also weird that my car had a thousand miles put on it over the course of a couple days. I thought Deadline had put the miles on it but I hadn't looked at the odometer until after Deadline had gone missing. Could John have put the miles on it? Maybe while taking Deadline somewhere far away?

John only knew of two places in Epoxyclypse. California City and Uranium Springs. 500 miles apart. There and back would be a thousand miles.

It was a long shot but hey this year's Cannibal Run was coming up. Might as well go and see if Deadline showed up.



I headed to Uranium Springs. 

What? You expected me to feel guilty about what happened last year? We do what we do. We learn from it or we don't.

No way I was entering that race again though. Why do you keep asking me that?

I'm just fucking with you. I have no idea what you're asking me. I just know that fuckers like you like to watch cunts like me suffer and that's why you're reading this.

But I'm not gonna give you that pleasure. I don't need the money this time like I did last time.

My little factory was producing three Firebuddies a day. I had back orders for months. I wasn't a billionaire yet but after this year's Gathering I'd be well on my way.

Or I thought I would be.

The moment I stepped out of my car I noticed a young punk wearing a computer on her arm. It wasn't some vintage toy or something neither. It was a nice piece. I'd never seen anything like it. She was walking around and fiddling with it nonstop. I stopped her and asked what it was. 

"Dingodongle" she said nonchalantly while fiddling.

I asked her what the fuck she was doing with it.

"Fuck off." She took off running for cover. Then she peeked out and pointed her arm at some bloke. He had on a Dingdong too and it made a noise and flashed. He fell to the ground.

I ran to him. I thought maybe he was dead. "Are you ok?" I asked. 

I reached down to grab his Dingdong. He pulled his arm away and got up. "Yeah dude it's just a game" he said.

He explained that the screen on his arm had a map which showed where other Dingdong users were. You could point your arm at them to shoot and their Dingdong would recognize whether you'd hit em or not. Some users showed up on the screen as people, some showed up as monsters. The graphics were amazing.

"What's the game called?"

"Alien Guzzaline Wars."

It said right there on the side "Dingodongle, MS Industries, What's-Left-O'Sydney, Australia."

Goddammit Mad Skelli was sexy. I now had a competitor. I should have destroyed that Firebuddy prototype I left sitting in the garage. I figured someone would strip it for precious metals. But Skelli had reverse engineered it and shrunk it down even faster than I had.

"Can it do anything else?" I asked. 

"Yeah all kinds of stuff. Mesh networking. Send people messages anywhere in the world. Access your You Are Awaited account. Pretty much everything."

I liked that he mentioned my social network but I wasn't making any money off of that. It existed solely to give people a reason to buy Firebuddies. Speaking of that....

"Why didn't you get a Firebuddy?" I asked.

"That thing doesn't have any games" he said. "Dingodongle's got like 50 different games man."

I looked around the streets of Uranium Springs. I counted two people with Firebuddies and 12 with Dingdongs. 

Dingodongles. Whatever.

Guess I'd have to write some games. And expand my production capacity. The former would take time. The latter would take money.

Last year's champion would return after all.



The rules of the Cannibal Run are anything but numerous. But one of the few rules they have says that once you're at the starting line you can't back out. I'm telling you this because I was already at the starting line when I saw someone who I'm pretty damn sure was Deadline. It was like looking up and seeing the goddamn Loch Ness monster.

The cunt was shooting pictures of the race with a camera the likes of which I'd never seen. The camera was big like an old large format camera but it had a bunch of wires and stuff coming out of it. I couldn't get a good look at the bloke's face because he was behind this giant camera. But I knew what I'd seen.

In Epoxyclypse you don't just take pictures. It's a time-consuming and expensive process. Not just because you gotta process and print them yourself. You usually gotta make your own cameras and emulsions too. You don't take pictures. You make photographs. 

This bloke was pointing and clicking and pointing and clicking and I didn't see him switching out any boxes or black bags to keep the light off of the emulsions. He might have been winding up a little roll of prewar film in there but then why the big camera? It could have been a TV camera but where was the video tape recorder?

I was so caught off guard by this that I missed the start flag.

The other cars took off and left me in a cloud of dust. I spun up the old 455 but not enough. I popped the clutch too quick and somehow managed to stall it despite having the torque of a freight train.

All I had to do was not come in last and I was already failing at that.

There were four cars in this year's race and I was in fourth. I finally got my badass car going. 

It's pretty easy to catch up to someone when you're chasing em. As long as the two of you are pretty evenly matched of course. You focus on doing whatever they're doing and you do it as fast as they're doing it. Then watch for their mistakes. Every mistake they make is an opportunity for you to catch up a bit. Just don't follow them blindly or you'll end up following them right into a tree or something. If they make a big mistake you've beaten them. As long as you don't make the same mistake they did.

I caught up to the fucker in third. Souped up AMC Gremlin. Cool car. Too bad the world would be losing one of them today.

There ain't no rules about crashing into people so the Cannibal Run was pretty much a demolition derby. I hated to mess up my Firebird's original paint but I'd do it for fame and fortune and the privilege of not being eaten.

Coming up from behind you're in a somewhat advantaged position because you can get right up against their bumper and push em off the road. But your car is vulnerable in front because of the radiator and stuff. Their rear bumper and trunk can take a lot of damage without any problem. Especially in Epoxyclypse where the cars all have spikes and shit coming off of em. So when you come up behind em they'll probably be hitting the brakes trying to get you to run into them harder than you want to. Most cars don't have brake lights or the bulbs are out or they're disconnected on purpose.

Then it hit me. Brake lights. I know I was supposed to be saving my own life but hey something's gonna kill me sooner or later. And I'll tell you a secret. I didn't actually write this shit down during the goddamn race. But during the goddamn race is when it hit me.

Brake lights. I remembered that time Deadline took me into his little workshop and showed me his weird invention. That little red light that came on when another light came on. It was a light sensor. That cunt must have made it smaller and lined up a bunch of them into an array.

Deadline had invented a working digital camera in Epoxyclypse. The Wasteland Communication Corporation had hired John to take him somewhere safe so he could finish his work.

Well that was my theory anyway. Fuck if I know if it's true. Cunt vanished and I didn't catch sight of him after that.

Sorry I know you fuckers want me to hurry up so you can imagine what I'd taste like if you had me for dinner. But my mind was racing as fast as my car was.

I was excited to hook up Deadline's camera to a Firebuddy. Imagine the magic that would come from that. Epoxyclypse was in a race with Tomorrowmorrowland and Epoxyclypse was catching up. The thought gave me goosebumps. 

Now I really needed to come in third. Remaining alive is cool and all but have you ever tried creating so much value for humanity that the world changed before your very eyes?

Fuck that fucking fucker and his Gremlin. I might even eat a little bit of him this time. Maybe I'll nibble his fingernail. Maybe a pinky.

When you're coming up behind someone in a car and you wanna fuck them up the best thing to try is to get beside them and use your nose to push their rear end sideways. I watched and waited for my opportunity. He went into a corner a little too fast and the weight shifted off his rear wheels. I gave him a little nudge. He countersteered but I pushed him far enough that the wheel locked and he went spinning.

I didn't win the race but I didn't die neither. I went home with some cash. 

Did I eat the pinky? Keep wondering. I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.

Good thing I hadn't learned my lesson last year. Fuck you karma. Not this time.
