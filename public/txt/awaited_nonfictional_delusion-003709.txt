[Firebird]

This year I was on site at Damnation Valley long before the Gathering even began. I was gonna be ready to find who I had to find and fight who I had to fight. I had 30 Firebuddies for sale this year.

I hadn't seen Deadline since the Cannibal Run. If I even saw him there. I'd communicated with John about that but he was either playing dumb or truly clueless.

A big truck appeared in the distance and crawled toward the Gathering site. It was towing a folding radio tower.

I got out of my car and waved. The suspense was killing me.

The truck pulled up. Swede climbed out of the driver's side. Deadline jumped out of the passenger's side. He was in disguise but it was him all right.

I hugged both of them cunts. I pointed at Deadline and told Swede "I found your news guy. It was the Twinkie on the chair that tipped me off."

Deadline had a camera on him like the one I'd seen at Detonation only smaller. It was a digital camera all right.

"How many photos per second can that thing shoot?" I asked.

"There's no film to advance so it's up'n walkin' quick" Deadline answered. "I've never pushed it to its limit cuz I have nowhere to store all that data."

Seemed like they should have been more excited. Now I know how Deadline felt when he showed me his digital light sensor. These drongos just didn't get it. I was gonna have to explain it to them.

"We could hook it up to a Firebuddy for storage and editing and processing and sharing content" I said. "All we need now is a digital audio recorder and we'd have a digital movie camera."

Swede and Deadline looked at each other and laughed.

"I've been using digital audio at the station for years" Swede said. "I can't be everywhere at once and I sleep sometimes too. Sometimes we even sell an ad." He pulled a little box out of his pocket and pressed a button. The box started talking in Swede's voice. "I'm the Swede and I've got what you need. This is Bob Crosby And The Bobcats with Way Back Home."

I pulled the latest model of Firebuddy out of my backpack. That's right you fuckers. Out of my fucking backpack. You thought I'd been slack?

Ain't no movie stars any more. Just us. We were gonna give em back their heroes.



By midnight I had them all working together.

I mounted the camera on a cart. Each of the components was portable on its own but the combination of all three connected with wires wasn't. Not yet.

I couldn't sleep. As soon as the sun came up I tried out the camera.

The first digital film footage taken in the Epoxyclypse timeline shows me, Swede, and Deadline standing around telling the story of our invention until we're interrupted by a Holden Sandman panel van pulling up behind us. Nice one too. I hadn't seen one of those in forever. On the side of the van were the words "MS Industries, What's-Left-O'Sydney, Australia."

Mad Skelli got out of the van.

And would you look at her.

She walked toward me with the sun rising behind her drawing clouds on the sky with colored chalk.

I had both the Loch Ness Monster and a goddamn mermaid right in front of me.

Tears were in my eyes. "I've missed you" I said.

"Go deep throat a chainsaw. We suffer for the attachments we fail to make, too." 


"Eat my arse with a spoon"
"go ride a dinosaur"
"suck on my pissflaps"
"i'll staple your dicksleeve to the floor"
