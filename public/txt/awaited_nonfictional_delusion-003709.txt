[Firebird]

This year I was on site at Damnation Valley long before the Gathering even began. I was gonna be ready to find who I had to find and fight who I had to fight. And I'd brought a heap of brand new Firebuddy2s to sell.

I hadn't seen Deadline since the Cannibal Run. If I even saw him there. I'd communicated with John about that but he was either playing dumb or truly clueless.

A military truck appeared in the distance and crawled toward the Gathering site. It was towing a folding radio tower.

I got out of my car and waved. The suspense was killing me.

The truck pulled up.

Swede climbed out of the driver side.

Deadline jumped out of the passenger side. He was in disguise but it was him all right. "What's buzzin cousin?" he asked.

I hugged both of them cunts. I pointed at Deadline and told Swede "I found your news guy. It was the Twinkie on the chair that tipped me off."

Deadline had a camera on him like the one I'd seen at Detonation only smaller. It was a digital camera all right.

"How many photos per second can that thing shoot?" I asked.

"There's no film to advance so it's quick as a bunny" Deadline answered. "I've never pushed it to its limit cuz I have nowhere to store all that data."

Seemed like they should have been more excited. Now I know how Deadline felt when he showed me his digital light sensor. These drongos just didn't get it. I was gonna have to explain it to them.

"We could hook it up to a Firebuddy for storage and editing and processing and sharing content" I said. "All we need now is a digital audio recorder and we'd have a digital movie camera."

Swede and Deadline looked at each other and laughed.

"I've been using digital audio at the station for years" Swede said. "I can't be everywhere at once and I sleep sometimes too. Sometimes we even sell an ad." He pulled a little box out of his pocket and pressed a button. The box started talking in Swede's voice. "I'm the Swede and I've got what you need. This is Bob Crosby And The Bobcats with Way Back Home."

I pulled a Firebuddy2 out of my backpack. That's right you fuckers. Out of my fucking backpack. You thought I'd been slack?

Ain't no movie stars any more. Just us. We were gonna give em back their heroes.



By midnight I had the digital movie camera working. 

I couldn't sleep. When morning came I tried out the camera. I'd mounted it on a cart. Each of the components was portable on its own but the combination of all three connected with wires wasn't. Not yet.

The first digital film footage taken in the Epoxyclypse timeline is me and Swede and Deadline in Damnation Valley sitting around telling the story of our invention.

Then a Holden Sandman pulled up. Nice one too. I hadn't seen one of those since I'd left Australia. On the side of the van were the words "MS Industries. What's-Left-O'Sydney Australia."

I stood up. Mad Skelli got out of the van.

And would you look at her. The rising sun drew clouds on the sky with colored chalk as she walked toward me.

Tears were in my eyes. "I've missed you" I said.

"I don't even know who you are any more."

"Last time I wasn't myself. It's a long story. I wrote it down. I have a copy of it right here. But I'm me again. And now you're here."

"I'm just here to sell computers. What happened last time doesn't matter. What mattered is that you were gone for ten years." She smiled distantly and hugged me.

I was about to learn some kind of lesson so it was a good thing that at that moment an arrow went into my leg.

We looked up to see a dust cloud billowing in the distance. Mohawk Asshole was cruising toward us in a buggy with a heap of cars behind him. He'd brought friends. I didn't know he had any. Well except for that one Skelli bumped off.

I pulled the arrow out.

Deadline said "Those guys are looking for trouble. We gotta burn rubber. Can you walk?"

Thunk. Another arrow. This one hit the Firebuddy. Fuck off. We're trying to make history here asshole.

"I can walk" I answered. "I'm deciding if I'm going to."

Thunk. This one? This one. This one hit my badass car.

"Gather round everyone" I said. I hopped over to my car and opened the trunk.

Skelli's face lit up. She grabbed the biggest gun I had. Nice.

Swede made an excellent choice. Deadline grabbed some weird old one.

I grabbed one with a bipod and scope and laid on the ground. You know which one of them assholes I was aiming for.

"Take out the leader with the mohawk" I said. "The rest of em will back off as soon as they realize they ain't getting paid. Let's facefuck this fuckface."

Then a school bus pulled in between us. Deliberately blocking my shot. Then it was joined by several more cars.

The first tribe of Gathering attendees had arrived. A heap of them got out of their cars and surrounded us. They were not going to let us have it out. There was no single person in charge telling us we couldn't fight. It was just a rule we all lived by. We were surrounded by a crowd of temporary pacifists.

"No fighting at the Gathering except for in the Cage" someone said. Then they grabbed me and put me in handcuffs. See what I mean when I say anarchy and government ain't so different?



They were gonna have us duke it out in the Cage that night. They would have just thrown us in the Cage right then and there but they were still putting the Cage together and my leg was fucked up.

They had a medical truck and a security truck. First I was gonna visit one then I was gonna visit the other.

A doctor in the medical truck fixed up my leg. Yeah I had to pay her. Doctor ain't gonna doct for free.

Then they dragged me to my cell in the back of the security truck. 

I had a cellmate. Good thing we were both chained to the wall.

"Little Shit" he said.

"Mohawk Asshole" I said.

He laughed. "Is that what you call me? That's good. I like it. How long ago was it that I killed your family?"

"Let's see. I've had my badass car for 37 years now. So that would have been 37 years ago."

"And in all that time we've never had a chance to talk."

"Sure we have. Usually I drive by. You yell something about wanting your car back. Maybe killing everyone I love."

"And you say 'Attachment leads to suffering.'"

"Those were my mother's last words."

"Were you attached to your family?"

"Were you attached to your car?"

"I still am. I love that car. I'm not usually much of a materialist but I am when it comes to that car. I special ordered it and had it imported from Yankeeland."

"You have excellent taste. I love every minute I spend in that car. It's like it was made for me."

"Do you know why I killed your family?"

This question caught me off guard. I'd always assumed my family was collateral damage in a senseless war.

"You don't know. I killed your family on purpose. I was trying to kill you too."

I looked him in the eye. I was physically calm but raging on the inside.

"I killed your family because your family killed my family."

He'd caught me off guard again. I wished they'd just unlock us and throw us in the Cage. I was tired of learning things about this asshole.

"I was born in Chile. Did you know that?"

"No."

"Did you know that you mother was an adviser to Pinochet?"

"Yeah. She was the Chicago Gal."

"Do you know what Pinochet did?"

"I heard a few things."

"Really? I didn't hear anything. I didn't see anything. To this day I don't know what Pinochet did. I don't know because one day my parents just vanished. I ended up in Australia as a refugee."
 
"My mom didn't kill your parents."

"She influenced the policies of the man who did."

"She influenced his economic policies." 

"She was complicit in the deaths of thousands."

"She saved Chile's economy."

"Chile didn't need saving. The people of Chile wanted to rule themselves."

"The socialists wanted to rule the people of Chile."

"The socialists were democratically elected."

"Democracy is two foxes and a goose that lays golden eggs deciding to have omelets for breakfast."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"Getting elected to steal from rich people is still stealing."

"We seized the means of production from those who would exploit our efforts."

"What are the means of production?"

"Factories and infrastructure."

"A factory is just a building. I own a factory. You can have it. Productivity is more than just poor people's efforts plus rich people's factories. Those are just the parts you can see."

"What else is there?"

"You can steal a factory. You can even steal an idea. But you can't steal ingenuity. You can't steal creativity. You can't steal persistence. The means of production is the human mind. If you put me on the guillotine you'd better save my head cuz you're gonna need it."

Wasteland Weekend was huge this year. Everyone had something big going on. Especially me.

I was camping beside Carolyn and Christine again. They'd met me, and they'd met Firebird, but I'm pretty sure they still thought we were the same person.

I'd be premiering my short film about Firebird's roadblock escapade at the Wasteland Film Festival. I'd taken this manuscript, written a fictionalized ending for it, and printed out copies in book form. I was handing them out for free, to promote the crowdfunding campaign for the full length movie.

The crowdfunding campaign hit its initial goal of $5,000 before Wasteland even began. That meant, at the very least, I'd be headed back to Australia in a few months to shoot the next scene. I'd also set up the additional stretch goals of $50,000 and $500,000.

This was the first time in my life that I'd ever created something that people were excited about. The campaign would continue for 30 days after Wasteland, and at that point I'd know if I were still a software engineer, or if I'd become a full time writer and director.

I was thrilled and terrified. I had taken every step with intention, but I still felt like I was being swept up in something beyond my control. Giving up control is my greatest fear. I don't even like admitting that. I hate even putting that sentence on down on paper. Or whatever medium you're reading this on.

Firebird and I had planned to trade places earlier, but he hadn't shown. If we weren't in the exact same spot, at the exact same time, we wouldn't swap. Now, trading places would either happen accidentally, or I wouldn't see him until our next planned meeting at Detonation/Cannibal Run. I was concerned because I knew Mohawk Asshole would be at the Gathering looking for him. We'd only planned to trade for an hour or so, because I did not want to deal with that guy.

I'd gotten permission to shoot scenes for my next film during Wasteland. In my fictionalized ending, I had Firebird and Mohawk Asshole facing off in the Thunderdome. Wasteland had its own Thunderdome so we planned to shoot the big fight scene there. Steve had flown all the way from Australia to experience Wasteland and help out with the film.

Carolyn and Christine volunteered to operate the cameras. We headed over to the Thunderdome to meet up with Steve.

The bouts had started. It was night but the Thunderdome was lit up bright as day. A crowd had surrounded the dome, flowed onto it, and spilled over it. Everyone was everywhere, and everyone was screaming.

Steve and I got in line. 

I've always hated fighting. I've always thought martial arts bouts, boxing, and even football should be outlawed. I couldn't stand watching that stuff, in real life, or even on TV. There are some rights that a person can't sign away in a contract. The right to not be assaulted should be one of them. 

But Thunderdome was downright primal.

In every bout, two people were strung up with bungees and launched at each other. It was just like in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. The weapons were bats covered with foam, but they looked real enough and they still stung. A woman kicked her best friend in the eye. A guy got flipped upside down, and his face was dragged through the dirt. Another guy dislocated his thumb. I'd never seen anything like it, and I'd never enjoyed anything like it, until now.

Steve and I were pumped. We didn't speak. We growled. We snarled. We gave each other looks. He hissed. He was actually starting to scare me, but my fear just made me meaner. 

Somewhere out there, there was another version of him who really wanted to kill me. When they strung us up on the bungees, I focused on that.



"He's trying to kill me over there!" Steve shouted.

"You deserve it over there," I explained.

"How do I know you don't deserve it over there?" Steve asked.

That was a good question.
