[Firebird]

This year I was on site at Damnation Valley long before the Gathering even began. I was gonna be ready to find who I had to find and fight who I had to fight. I had 30 Firebuddies for sale this year.

I hadn't seen Deadline since the Cannibal Run. If I even saw him there. I'd communicated with John about that but he was either playing dumb or truly clueless.

A military truck appeared in the distance and crawled toward the Gathering site. It was towing a folding radio tower.

I got out of my car and waved. The suspense was killing me.

The truck pulled up.

Swede climbed out of the driver's side.

Deadline jumped out of the passenger's side. He was in disguise but it was him all right. "What's buzzin cousin?" he asked.

I hugged both of them cunts. I pointed at Deadline and told Swede "I found your news guy. It was the Twinkie on the chair that tipped me off."

Deadline had a camera on him like the one I'd seen at Detonation only smaller. It was a digital camera all right.

"How many photos per second can that thing shoot?" I asked.

"There's no film to advance so it's quick as a bunny" Deadline answered. "I've never pushed it to its limit cuz I have nowhere to store all that data."

Seemed like they should have been more excited. Now I know how Deadline felt when he showed me his digital light sensor. These drongos just didn't get it. I was gonna have to explain it to them.

"We could hook it up to a Firebuddy for storage and editing and processing and sharing content" I said. "All we need now is a digital audio recorder and we'd have a digital movie camera."

Swede and Deadline looked at each other and laughed.

"I've been using digital audio at the station for years" Swede said. "I can't be everywhere at once and I sleep sometimes too. Sometimes we even sell an ad." He pulled a little box out of his pocket and pressed a button. The box started talking in Swede's voice. "I'm the Swede and I've got what you need. This is Bob Crosby And The Bobcats with Way Back Home."

I pulled the latest model of Firebuddy out of my backpack. That's right you fuckers. Out of my fucking backpack. You thought I'd been slack?

Ain't no movie stars any more. Just us. We were gonna give em back their heroes.



By midnight I had the camera working. 

I couldn't sleep. When morning came I tried out the camera. I'd mounted it on a cart. Each of the components was portable on its own but the combination of all three connected with wires wasn't. Not yet. The cart had a wire going back to a generator Swede had brought. We'd get it working on batteries eventually but what mattered right now was we had proof that it could be done.

The first digital film footage taken in the Epoxyclypse timeline shows me and Swede and Deadline sitting around telling the story of our invention. Then a Holden Sandman panel van pulls up. Nice one too. On the side of the van were the words "MS Industries. What's-Left-O'Sydney Australia."

I stood up. Mad Skelli got out of the van. And would you look at her. The rising sun drew clouds on the sky with colored chalk as she walked toward me.

Tears were in my eyes. "I've missed you" I said.

"I don't even know who you are any more."

"Last time I wasn't myself. It's a long story. I wrote it down." I showed her my copy of this document. "But I'm me again. And now you're here."

"I'm just here to sell computers. What happened last time doesn't matter. What mattered is that you were gone for ten years." She smiled distantly and gave me a hug. "We also suffer for the attachments we fail to make." 

I was about to learn some kind of lesson when thunk. An arrow landed in the ground right by our feet.

We looked up to see a dust cloud billowing in the distance. Mohawk Asshole was flying toward us in a buggy. And he'd brought friends. I didn't know he had any friends. Except for that one Skelli bumped off.

Deadline said "We got some eager beavers looking for trouble. We'd better burn rubber." He turned to head for the truck but tripped over the camera's power cord. He hit the ground hard and wasn't moving. Swede and Skelli tried to get him up.

Thunk. Another arrow. This one hit the Firebuddy. We're trying to make history here asshole.

Thunk. This one. This one hit my badass car.








"Go deep throat a chainsaw."
"Eat my arse with a spoon"
"go ride a dinosaur"
"suck on my pissflaps"
"i'll staple your dicksleeve to the floor"

Mohawk Asshole confronts Firebird. MA accuses FB of theft. FB accuses MA of attempted murder. so both go to jail while awaiting their bout in the Cage/Thunderdome. firebird and MA stuck in shackles together before cage match, debating capitalism vs. socialism. "what's so much better about greedy socialists than greedy capitalists?" "socialists are elected." "capitalists are elected too. my dollar is my vote." MA's epoxyname is Warez? MA reveals his secret, seeks revenge, is defeated when out of nowhere, steve trades places with MA to save firebird and/or john. ¡¡¡CHILEAN FASCISM KILLED MOHAWK ASSHOLE'S PARENTS AND HE CAME TO AUSTRALIA AS A REFUGEE! HE BLAMES MY MOM FOR HIS PARENTS' DEATH!!! when Mohawk Asshole gets a chance to talk we need to hear why he blew up the airport, and it has to be a sympathetic-ish reason. maybe Mohawk Asshole is like antifa, he blew up airport because he was targeting my mom because he thought she was connected to chilean fascism and pinochet and trying to bring it to australia. he killed her on purpose!
