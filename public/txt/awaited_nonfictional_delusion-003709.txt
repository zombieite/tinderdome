[Firebird]

This year I was on site before the Gathering even began. My car was parked at the site of the Wasteland Communication Corporation's camp. I was gonna find who I had to find and fight who I had to fight.

I had communicated with John since the Cannibal Run but he was either playing dumb or truly clueless about Deadline.

A big truck appeared in the distance and crawled toward me. It had a folding radio tower on the back.

I got out of my car and smiled. The suspense was killing me.

The truck pulled up. Swede climbed out of the driver's side. Deadline jumped out of the passenger's side. He was in disguise but it was him all right.

I hugged both of them cunts. I pointed at Deadline and told Swede "I found your news guy. It was the Twinkie on the chair that tipped me off."

Deadline had a camera on him like the one I'd seen at Detonation only smaller. It was a digital camera all right.

"How many photos per second can that thing shoot?" I asked.

"There's no film to advance so it's up'n walkin' quick" Deadline answered. "I've never pushed it to its limit cuz I have nowhere to store all that data."

Now I know how Deadline felt when he showed my his digital light sensor. These drongos just didn't get it. I was gonna have to explain it to them.

"We could hook it up to a Firebuddy for storage and editing and processing and sharing content" I said. "All we need now is a digital audio recorder and we'd have a digital movie camera."

Swede and Deadline looked at each other and laughed.

"I've been using digital audio at the station for years" Swede said. "I can't be everywhere at once and I sleep sometimes too." He pulled a little box out of his pocket and pressed a button. The box started talking in Swede's voice. "I'm the Swede and I've got what you need. This is Bob Crosby And The Bobcats with Way Back Home."

I pulled the latest model of Firebuddy out of my backpack. That's right you fuckers. Out of my fucking backpack. What you thought I'd been slack?

By midnight I had them all working together.

Ain't no movie stars any more. Just us. We were gonna give the world back their heroes. John was making his movie and I was gonna make mine.
