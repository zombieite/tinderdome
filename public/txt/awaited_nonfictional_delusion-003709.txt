[Firebird]

This year I was on site at Damnation Valley long before the Gathering even began. I was gonna be ready to find who I had to find and fight who I had to fight. And I'd brought a heap of brand new Firebuddy2s to sell.

I hadn't seen Deadline since the Cannibal Run. If I even saw him there. I'd communicated with John about that but he was either playing dumb or truly clueless.

A military truck appeared in the distance and crawled toward the Gathering site. It was towing a folding radio tower.

I got out of my car and waved. The suspense was killing me.

The truck pulled up.

Swede climbed out of the driver's side.

Deadline jumped out of the passenger's side. He was in disguise but it was him all right. "What's buzzin cousin?" he asked.

I hugged both of them cunts. I pointed at Deadline and told Swede "I found your news guy. It was the Twinkie on the chair that tipped me off."

Deadline had a camera on him like the one I'd seen at Detonation only smaller. It was a digital camera all right.

"How many photos per second can that thing shoot?" I asked.

"There's no film to advance so it's quick as a bunny" Deadline answered. "I've never pushed it to its limit cuz I have nowhere to store all that data."

Seemed like they should have been more excited. Now I know how Deadline felt when he showed me his digital light sensor. These drongos just didn't get it. I was gonna have to explain it to them.

"We could hook it up to a Firebuddy for storage and editing and processing and sharing content" I said. "All we need now is a digital audio recorder and we'd have a digital movie camera."

Swede and Deadline looked at each other and laughed.

"I've been using digital audio at the station for years" Swede said. "I can't be everywhere at once and I sleep sometimes too. Sometimes we even sell an ad." He pulled a little box out of his pocket and pressed a button. The box started talking in Swede's voice. "I'm the Swede and I've got what you need. This is Bob Crosby And The Bobcats with Way Back Home."

I pulled a Firebuddy2 out of my backpack. That's right you fuckers. Out of my fucking backpack. You thought I'd been slack?

Ain't no movie stars any more. Just us. We were gonna give em back their heroes.



By midnight I had the digital movie camera working. 

I couldn't sleep. When morning came I tried out the camera. I'd mounted it on a cart. Each of the components was portable on its own but the combination of all three connected with wires wasn't. Not yet.

The first digital film footage taken in the Epoxyclypse timeline is me and Swede and Deadline in Damnation Valley sitting around telling the story of our invention.

Then a Holden Sandman pulled up. Nice one too. I hadn't seen one of those since I'd left Australia. On the side of the van were the words "MS Industries. What's-Left-O'Sydney Australia."

I stood up. Mad Skelli got out of the van.

And would you look at her. The rising sun drew clouds on the sky with colored chalk as she walked toward me.

Tears were in my eyes. "I've missed you" I said.

"I don't even know who you are any more."

"Last time I wasn't myself. It's a long story. I wrote it down. I have a copy of it right here. But I'm me again. And now you're here."

"I'm just here to sell computers. What happened last time doesn't matter. What mattered is that you were gone for ten years." She smiled distantly and hugged me.

I was about to learn some kind of lesson so it was a good thing that at that moment an arrow went into my leg.

We looked up to see a dust cloud billowing in the distance. Mohawk Asshole was cruising toward us in a buggy with a heap of cars behind him. He'd brought friends. I didn't know he had any. Well except for that one Skelli bumped off.

I pulled the arrow out.

Deadline said "Those guys are looking for trouble. We gotta burn rubber. Can you walk?"

Thunk. Another arrow. This one hit the Firebuddy. Fuck off. We're trying to make history here asshole.

"I can walk" I answered. "I'm deciding if I'm going to."

Thunk. This one? This one. This one hit my badass car.

"Gather round everyone" I said. I hopped over to my car and opened the trunk.

Skelli's face lit up. She grabbed the biggest gun I had. Nice.

Swede made an excellent choice. Deadline grabbed some weird old one.

I grabbed one with a bipod and scope and laid on the ground. You know which one of them assholes I was aiming for.

"Take out the leader with the mohawk" I said. "The rest of em will back off as soon as they realize they ain't getting paid. Let's facefuck this fuckface."

Then a school bus pulled in between us. Deliberately blocking my shot. Then it was joined by several more cars.

The first tribe of Gathering attendees had arrived. A heap of them got out of their cars and surrounded us. They were not going to let us have it out. There was no single person in charge telling us we couldn't fight. It was just a rule we all lived by. We were surrounded by a crowd of temporary pacifists.

"No fighting at the Gathering except for in the Cage" someone said. Then they grabbed me and put me in handcuffs. See what I mean when I say anarchy and government ain't so different?



A doctor fixed up my leg. Yeah I had to pay her. Doctor ain't gonna doct for free.

One concern I had now was John and I had agreed to trade places half an hour ago but I'd been dragged away from the spot we were supposed to meet. That meant either we wouldn't trade places or it would happen by accident or he'd come looking for me and it would happen by surprise.

They led me to my cell. 

I had a cellmate. Good thing we were both chained to the wall.

"Little Shit" he said.

"Mohawk Asshole" I said.

He laughed. "Is that what you call me? That's good. I like it. How long ago was it that I killed your family?"

"I've had my badass car for 37 years now. So 37 years ago."

"And in all that time we've never had a chance to talk."

"Sure we have. I drive by. You yell something about wanting your car back. Maybe killing everyone I love."

"And you say 'Attachment leads to suffering.'"

"Those were my mother's last words."

"Were you attached to your family?"

"Were you attached to your car?"

"Yes I was. I loved that car. I'm not much of a materialist but I was when it came to that car. I special ordered it and had it imported from Yankeeland."

"You have excellent taste. I love every minute I spend in that car. It's like it was made for me."

"Do you know why I killed your family?"

This question caught me off guard. I'd always assumed my family was collateral damage in a stupid war.

"Oh you didn't know? I killed your family on purpose. I was trying to kill you too."

I looked him in the eye. I was physically calm but raging on the inside.

"I killed your family because your family killed my family."

He'd caught me off guard again. I wished they'd just unlock us and throw us in the Cage. I was tired of learning things about this asshole.

"I was born in Chile. Did you know that?"

"No."

"Did you know that you mother was an adviser to Pinochet?"

"Yeah. She was the Chicago Gal."

"Do you know what Pinochet did?"

"I heard a few things."

"Really? I didn't hear anything. I didn't see anything. To this day I don't know what Pinochet did. I don't know because one day my parents just vanished."
 
"My mom didn't kill em."

"No but she influenced the policies of the man who did."

"She influenced his economic policies. She saved their economy."

"The people of Chile didn't want to be saved. The people of Chile wanted to rule themselves."

"The socialists wanted to rule the people of Chile."

"We seized the means of production from those who exploited our efforts."

"What are the means of production?"

"Factories and other infrastructure owned by the rich."

"A factory is just a building. I own a factory. You can have it. Productivity is more than just rich people's factories plus poor people's efforts. Those are just the parts you can see. Productivity is something far greater than the sum of its visible parts."

"What else is there?"

"The human mind is the means of production. You can steal a factory. You can even steal an idea. But you can't steal ingenuity. You can't steal creativity. You can't steal persistence. If you put me in the guillotine you'd better save my head cuz you're gonna need it."

"We made some omelets. We broke some eggs. But your mother was complicit in the deaths of thousands of Chileans. She was coming for Australia next. I put an end to that."

"You put an end to the whole world."

"I set off a few bombs. No one knows who killed the world."

"Setting off bombs didn't help."
