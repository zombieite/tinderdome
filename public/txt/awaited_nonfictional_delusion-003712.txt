[Narrator: John]

The cops never found Mohawk Asshole. Cops don't find criminals. Cops don't solve crimes, like on TV. Cops just lurk around and try to pin stuff on everyone they see until they hit their quotas. Firebird's right. Our cops aren't any more real than his are.

I tried to get Firebird to talk with Steve, but he wouldn't do it.

I got another old Trans Am. I got a Martinique Blue '78. I loved it almost as much as I'd loved my '75. But attachment leads to suffering. I had to learn to give up my attachments. I would have to suffer.

Firebird and I had cameras. Firebird and I had money. Firebird and I had a story to tell.

We wrote this story down in both timelines. Why not make our movie in both timelines too?

We could shoot in the same places at the same times. We could even trade places to direct the scenes we'd experienced, and play ourselves in each others' movies. And by doing this, we'd get guided tours of alternate timelines.

We headed to Australia first.

Watching our actors recreate the death of Firebird's family hit me harder than I thought it would. The boys we found to portray us as children both did wonderful jobs of it.

I did all the stunts in our car chases. I didn't want to be responsible for someone else getting hurt. The big one was climbing out of the moving Valiant into the Trans Am while it was being towed by a tow truck. It was easy for Firebird because he'd done it for real. But I figured, if he'd done it, I could do it. And I did.

Firebird persuaded Mad Skelli to portray herself in the film. I got to meet her again. She was indeed something. Once she'd read this manuscript and talked to both of us back to back, she even believed our story.

I'd gotten word that Steve was back in Australia working as a tattoo artist in Epoxyclypse. I found his shop and stopped in.

I explained that I'd been trading timelines for years, but it was a risky thing to do. If your counterpart failed to meet up with you, you'd be stuck. We still had no idea where Mohawk Asshole had gone to in Tomorrowmorrowland. We might never know.

"No worries mate," Steve said. "Life is an adventure."



[Narrator: Firebird]

John and I were road tripping to New Jersey. Reenacting the trip I'd made seven years ago.



There are three places that looked the same before and after the apocalypse: Wasteland Weekend. Uranium Springs. And New Jersey.



Out of nowhere a car appeared. Heading straight for the Trans Am. I jumped onto the hood just as the cars collided. The car slipped under me and I ended up on the ground.

A woman got out and pointed a gun at me.

"Attachment leads to suffering." I said. "That's what my mom used to say."

"Do you know who I am?" she asked.

"I know who you are." I could forget a name but I could never forget the face of the woman who wailed over the murder and roasting and consumption of a man whose name I'd forgotten. "Where's the kid?"

"I found a sitter."

"How'd you find me?"

"I've done nothing but look for you."

I looked down the barrel. I knew that this time the gun was loaded.

And this gun was special. This was a gun was itching to go off. Not a single gun has been fired in this narrative and we're getting near the end. Why would I have put guns in the story if no one shoots any of em? If this story is fictional then the gun has to go off. My only hope is that this story is nonfictional.

"If I were in your shoes I'd walk just as you do" I said.

We shared a moment in silence.

"What does that mean?" she asked.

I looked her in the eye. "If I were you I'd do just as you are doing."

Another moment.

She sat down on a bench. I sat down beside her.

"What was your husband's name?" I asked.

"I don't remember" she replied.

"Me neither."

"I remember" she said. "But sometimes I like to pretend I don't. I like to pretend it doesn't matter. I like to pretend he doesn't care."

"Does he care?"

"Before the race he begged me. He said if anything went wrong I had to promise not to forget him. He couldn't stop saying it. He still makes me promise him that. Every night in my dreams."

"When I see my mom in my dreams it's a dead giveaway. I instantly know I'm dreaming because I know she's dead. But in that moment I can tell her everything I want to tell her."

"What do you want to tell her?"

Another moment.

"There's nothing I want to tell her."

"There's something she wants to tell you. She didn't finish. Attachment leads to suffering. That doesn't mean don't get attached. You also suffer for the attachments you fail to make. It means choose your attachments wisely. When you can choose them."

"Can I choose to have no attachments?"

"No."

"Then what have I been doing my whole life?"

"Denying you have attachments."

Who I was when I started writing this manuscript is not who I am today. Maybe now I could tell this story in the voice of that little boy whose family got blown to bits.

It was not that my experiences turned me back into that child.

I've always been that child.
