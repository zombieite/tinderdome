I looked down the barrel. I knew that this time the gun would be loaded. And being loaded was not the only thing different about this gun. This gun was special. This was a gun that was itching to go off. Not a single gun has been fired in this story and we're getting near the end so if this story is fictional then this one has to go off. Why would I mention guns if no one shoots them? If this story is nonfictional then maybe I still have a chance.

"If I were in your shoes I'd walk just as you do" I said.

A moment passed in silence.

"What do you mean" she asked.

I looked her square in the eye. "If I were you I'd do just as you are doing."

Another moment.

She sat down. I sat down beside her.

"What was your husband's name?"

"I don't remember."

I gave her just the look you would have given her if you were sitting where I was sitting.

"I remember. But sometimes I like to pretend I don't. I like to pretend it doesn't matter. I like to pretend he doesn't care if I remember him."

"Does he care?"

"Before the race he begged me. He couldn't stop saying it. He said if anything went wrong I had to promise to remember him. He still makes me promise him that. Every night in my dreams."

"When I see my mom in my dreams it's an dead giveaway. I instantly know I'm dreaming because she's dead. I know in that moment we can do anything we want. I can say anything I want to her."

"What do you want to say to her?"

A long moment passed.

"There's nothing I want to say to her. Just stuff I want to show her."

"What do you want to show her?"

"Everything in the world. I want to show her how happy I am. She always wanted me to be happy and for me to be a good person. One of her wishes came true."

"There's something she wants to tell you. She didn't finish. Attachment leads to suffering. That doesn't mean don't get attached. You suffer for the attachments you fail to make too. It means choose your attachments wisely. When you can choose them."

"I can't choose to have no attachments?"

"No."

"What have I been doing my whole life?"

"Denying you have them."

Who I was when I started writing this manuscript is not who I am today. Maybe now I could tell this story in the voice of that little kid whose family got blown to bits.

It was not my experiences that turned me back into that child.

I have always been that child.
