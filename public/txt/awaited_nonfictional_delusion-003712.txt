The cops never found Mohawk Asshole. Cops don't find criminals. Cops don't solve crimes, like on TV. Cops just lurk around and try to pin stuff on everyone they see until they hit their quotas. Firebird's right. Our cops aren't any more real than his are.

I tried to get Firebird to talk with Steve, but he wouldn't do it. I understood. Steve went back to Australia to work as a tattoo artist in Epoxyclypse. Word is he's having a blast. Life is an adventure.

I got another old Trans Am. I got a Martinique Blue '78. I loved it almost as much as I'd loved my '75. But attachment leads to suffering. I had to learn to give up my attachments. I had to suffer.

Firebird and I had cameras. Firebird and I had money. Firebird and I had a story to tell.

Just like we wrote this story down in both timelines, we were gonna make our movie in both timelines too. Some parts would be fictional, some parts would be nonfictional. We'd let the audience figure it out.



That was the last time I traded places with Firebird. I still don't know why. I might never know.

We were only able to copy our writings into each others' manuscripts when we traded places. So we're writing our endings without each other. If anyone out there has read it and crossed over from Epoxyclypse, please get in touch and let me know how Firebird's story ends.

Here's how it ended for me.

The movie was a flop in the US. But Australians went mad for it. That might explain how she found me.

I got an email from a woman in Australia.

"I was knocked senseless and moved to tears when I watched your film. When Firebird and Mad Skelli drive back to O'Sydney, they have a conversation. Hearing that conversation was the most surreal moment of my life. 

"Mad Skelli shares a very personal detail of her life. That detail of her life is something which is also true of my life. It's so personal and painful that I don't even like to put it down in words.

"I realize it's possible that you found me on the internet and decided to plagiarize my life. If so, creepy. But I couldn't get it out of my head that maybe we'd met in another life and you were still out there waiting for me.

"My name is Kelli Shackleford. Kelli S.

"I think I am Mad Skelli.

"I had to email you to hear what you had to say about all of this."



Kelli Shackleford came to the US to attend Wasteland Weekend that year. We went up to the memorial together.

She took out a marker and wrote on the memorial:


    BELOVED TWIN NIKKI


I took the marker from her and wrote:


    ATTACHMENT LEADS TO SUFFERING--DEANNA BINNS


We turned to face the campsites in the distance. We hatched a little plan.

On the count of three, we screamed, "Fuck you!"

A thousand tiny people heard us. A thousand tiny voices shouted back.


    THE END



[Firebird]

Out of nowhere a car appeared. Heading straight for the Trans Am. I jumped onto the hood just as the cars collided. The car slipped under me and I ended up on the ground.

A woman got out and pointed a gun at me.

"Attachment leads to suffering." I said. "That's what my mom used to say."

"Do you know who I am?" she asked.

"I know who you are." I could forget a name but I could never forget the face of the woman who wailed over the murder and roasting and consumption of a man whose name I'd forgotten. "Where's the kid?"

"I found a sitter."

"How'd you find me?"

"I've done nothing but look for you."

I looked down the barrel. I knew that this time the gun was loaded.

And this gun was special. This was a gun was itching to go off. Not a single gun has been fired in this narrative and we're getting near the end. Why would I have put guns in the story if no one shoots any of em? If this story is fictional then the gun has to go off. My only hope is that this story is nonfictional.

"If I were in your shoes I'd walk just as you do" I said.

We shared a moment in silence.

"What does that mean?" she asked.

I looked her in the eye. "If I were you I'd do just as you are doing."

Another moment.

She sat down on a bench. I sat down beside her.

"What was your husband's name?" I asked.

"I don't remember" she replied.

"Me neither."

"I remember" she said. "But sometimes I like to pretend I don't. I like to pretend it doesn't matter. I like to pretend he doesn't care."

"Does he care?"

"Before the race he begged me. He said if anything went wrong I had to promise not to forget him. He couldn't stop saying it. He still makes me promise him that. Every night in my dreams."

"When I see my mom in my dreams it's a dead giveaway. I instantly know I'm dreaming because I know she's dead. But in that moment I can tell her everything I want to tell her."

"What do you want to tell her?"

Another moment.

"There's nothing I want to tell her."

"There's something she wants to tell you. She didn't finish. Attachment leads to suffering. That doesn't mean don't get attached. You also suffer for the attachments you fail to make. It means choose your attachments wisely. When you can choose them."

"Can I choose to have no attachments?"

"No."

"Then what have I been doing my whole life?"

"Denying you have attachments."

Who I was when I started writing this manuscript is not who I am today. Maybe now I could tell this story in the voice of that little boy whose family got blown to bits.

It was not that my experiences turned me back into that child.

I've always been that child.
