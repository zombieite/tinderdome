[Firebird]

Out of nowhere a car appeared. Heading straight for the Trans Am. I jumped onto the hood just as the cars collided. The car slipped under me and I ended up on the ground.

A woman got out and pointed a gun at me.

"Attachment leads to suffering. That's what my mom used to say."

"Do you know who I am?" she asked.

"I know who you are." I could forget a name but I could never forget the face of the woman who wailed over the murder and roasting and consumption of a man whose name I'd forgotten. "Where's the kid?"

"I found a sitter."

"How'd you find me?"

"I've done nothing but look for you."

I looked down the barrel. I knew that this time the gun was loaded.

And this gun was special. This was a gun was itching to go off. Not a single gun has been fired in this narrative and we're getting near the end. Why would I have put guns in the story if no one shoots any of em? If this story is fictional then the gun has to go off. My only hope is that this story is nonfictional.

"If I were in your shoes I'd walk just as you do" I said.

We shared a moment in silence.

"What does that mean?" she asked.

I looked her in the eye. "If I were you I'd do just as you are doing."

Another moment.

She sat down on a bench. I sat down beside her.

"What was your husband's name?" I asked.

"I don't remember" she replied.

"Me neither."

"I remember" she said. "But sometimes I like to pretend I don't. I like to pretend it doesn't matter. I like to pretend he doesn't care."

"Does he care?"

"Before the race he begged me. He said if anything went wrong I had to promise not to forget him. He couldn't stop saying it. He still makes me promise him that. Every night in my dreams."

"When I see my mom in my dreams it's a dead giveaway. I instantly know I'm dreaming because I know she's dead. But in that moment I can tell her everything I want to tell her."

"What do you want to tell her?"

Another moment.

"There's nothing I want to tell her."

"There's something she wants to tell you. She didn't finish. Attachment leads to suffering. That doesn't mean don't get attached. You also suffer for the attachments you fail to make. It means choose your attachments wisely. When you can choose them."

"Can I choose to have no attachments?"

"No."

"Then what have I been doing my whole life?"

"Denying you have attachments."

Who I was when I started writing this manuscript is not who I am today. Maybe now I could tell this story in the voice of that little boy whose family got blown to bits.

It was not that my experiences turned me back into that child.

I've always been that child.
