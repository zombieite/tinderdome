[Firebird]

People call me Firebird. I was born in New Jersey USA.

My mom was an economist. She was known as the "Chicago Girl" because she'd studied at the University of Chicago. She spent some time in Chile helping them get their economy off the ground. Dad was a doctor. In his spare time he'd make electronic gizmos. Hell he built the goddamn television we watched every night.

My life got ugly and interesting around the time that mom was invited to speak at a political conference in Australia. Dad had just lost his job so we all tagged along. Mom and dad went scuba diving. Dad took pictures of the fish and the coral and shit. He had a darkroom in our house where he'd print the pictures up himself. Me and my little sister sat around bored. 

Back then there was an oil crisis and a hostage crisis and the Cold War. Assholes starting wars. Assholes committing acts of terrorism. That shit was all over the news at the Sydney airport when we were waiting in line to fly home. Everyone was stressed the fuck out. My sister was screaming that she was hungry. 

Dad had this cool self-winding dive watch. I asked if I could try it on and he let me. 

I got bored with that so I reached in my pocket and whipped out my favorite Hot Wheels car. It was a 1977 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am just like the Bandit drove.

I got sick of listening to my sister scream so I told her to shut up. 

Mom got mad and grabbed the Hot Wheels out of my hand. She made me tell my sister I was sorry. Then she gave me some shrapnel and told me to go buy my sister some cookies. 

"Then can I have my Hot Wheels back?" I asked.

"Attachment leads to suffering" she said.

I went to the newsstand and grabbed some Tim Tams. The bloke pushed some buttons on his cash register.
 
We call it The Big Bang but it wasn't a big bang for everyone. It wasn't one single thing that happened. There were big bangs. There were little bangs. Hell froze over and heaven got too hot. Depends who you ask. For me it was a little bang but it was big enough.

The cash register bell rang and the drawer opened. Then KABOOM. I saw my Hot Wheels Firebird go racing across the floor faster than it had ever gone before. 

The cashier was dead so I grabbed the Tim Tams.

There was smoke everywhere. People were running in every direction but I followed that Hot Wheels car right out the exit door. I bent over and picked it up. 

An asshole with a mohawk slammed into me and we both fell to the ground. He was pissed. He had a big fucking gun which was pointed at my brain. But a bunch of cops ran up and jumped on him and fucked him up.

There was chaos everywhere except for one thing. It was like the universe was apologizing for being an asshole to me that day because sitting right there before my eyes was a real life Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. Its engine was running. The driver's door was open. And the radio was playing Back in Black.

I went up to the car started to get in. I took a look back at Mohawk Asshole. Cops had him. He was fucked up in handcuffs shouting "Little Shit! That's my car!"

"Attachment leads to suffering" I yelled before driving away in my NEW CAR. Hell yeah the price was right. Johnny Olson. Bob motherfucking Barker. I ripped open them Tim Tams and ate them all up.

I found a bunch of badass terrorist guns in the trunk of my badass car. Having them guns helped a lot cuz I was just a kid and I had to raise myself in the Epoxyclypse from then on.

Since we'd pushed the reset button on the whole world some of us called it Year Zero. In Year Zero I was an American kid stuck in Australia.

Things were bad for a while. People bumped people off for fun or because they wanted to eat them. I didn't bump off too many people and I didn't eat anybody but I would've if I'd had to. Grub first then ethics someone said.

Mostly I read a lot of books on economics and electronics and photography. I was gonna be one of them clever cunts who creates wealth by inventing shit. Not one of them assholes who gets their shrapnel by grabbing it out of other people's pockets. I've grabbed plenty of shit in my time but it's never been my preferred way of life. 	

I'm probably not telling this story right cuz I'm supposed to be making you like me. I probably sound like I didn't care that my family got blown to smithereens. If I could tell this story in the voice of that little kid back then I might tell it different. We see who we were through the eyes of who we've become. Nowadays I don't give a fuck about anything. I had lots of good memories back then but that's all gone now. Things changed that day and I became someone else.

Well one of me did anyway.
