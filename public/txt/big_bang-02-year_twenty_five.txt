[Firebird]

Some of you ain't lived through anarchy so let me tell you about it. Throughout most of human existence there was no government so anarchy is our natural state. Anarchy is not the absence of order. It's the absence of government. With anarchy you have some disorder but you also have something called spontaneous order. 

People don't fight if they can avoid it. Von Mises said if the tailor kills the baker now the tailor's gotta learn how to bake bread. No matter how good you are at fighting there's always someone better. No matter how big you are there's someone bigger. You could bring the best weapon in the world and the other guy will bring two of em. And no matter how good you are all someone has to do is sneak up on you or shoot you from a distance. Conflict resolution keeps you alive and not kicking. Yeah there is some fighting but governments fighting is what got us here so having a government ain't much better than not having one.

Anarchy and government are not as different as you think. Government is just whatever gang has the biggest pile of guns. When people take the big pile of guns away from one gang and give it to another gang they call it an election. When the gang grabs your money they call it taxes. A border is just a line in the sand you're capable of defending. Laws. Good people don't need em. Bad people don't follow em. Ammon Hennacy said that. Or maybe it was Playdoh. They're both dead so who gives a fuck. Firebird said it.

You probably think we eat food out of fifty year old cans and bugs off the ground. Sometimes. But ask yourself where does your water come from? Where does your electric come from? Where does your gasoline come from? You don't know. It don't come from the government. It don't come from socialism. It don't come from capitalism. That shit comes from anarchy. Someone wants your money so they make shit you need and they deliver it to you. We still got that here. That ain't never going away. We got food and gas and electricity and all that shit. You don't know how they make it cuz you don't need to know. Everything is just expensive as fuck. What you call the black market we call the market. There's even some computers and TVs and radios but they ain't as good as yours. We don't have phone lines or power lines cuz them wires don't stay up long. We got guns but not much ammo. Motherfuckers carry around broken guns or fake guns. They mount them on their cars.

We don't go to school but if you think that means we don't learn then let me learn you something. We learn what we need to learn and we learn what we want to learn. I started learning the moment I stopped going to school. 

And no we don't barter all the time. Sometimes. Money still works. People use money cuz it's convenient. Not cuz a government says it's worth anything. But with no more currency being produced we got deflation instead of inflation. Bills crumpled to dust and coins went up in value. It takes all day to earn a quarter but a quarter buys you a hot meal. People sometimes trade foreign coins and coins out of their antique coin collections and ball bearings and bottlecaps. Anything small and valuable. But value is subjective. Just cuz you think something is valuable don't mean someone else will. So shit like bottlecaps don't always work. Money stored on plastic cards is all gone but I bet somecunt out there is working on reinventing that shit right now. And if they don't maybe I will.

Another question you might have is why don't everyone just grab stuff from each other. You can do that but it's rude and it's dangerous. Some people carry their life savings on them but you are not getting it off of them. Some people hide their money. Some people put their money into banks but that's risky cuz days are back where robbing banks might be a good way to make a living. People grab cars all the time. You own whatever you can defend. Anything undefended gets grabbed or repurposed. Assholes grab shit. Clever cunts like me don't need to grab shit. We think of ways to give you what you need for a price. I might be an asshole too sometimes but I am making the world spin.

Here is the one rule you need to live by no matter what planet you live on or what government you have to live with. No matter if you're trying to make money or make friends. This rule is better than the golden rule. Better than the platinum rule. It's the goddamn best rule.

Create value for everyone around you all the time. To keep yourself from being killed. To make money. To make friends. To fall in love. Create value for those who can't repay you. That's kindness. Create value for those who repay you with companionship. That's friendship. Create value for those who pay you with money. That's work. Like I said before value is subjective so it can be a challenge to figure out what people need from you. Most people don't know what they need so they won't be able to tell you. They might not need anything from you. In that case you just walk on by. At least until tomorrow when you see them again and you realize what it is that they fucking need. Then you stop them and introduce yourself and you explain how you are about to make their day better. Don't give that value away though. Don't let them grab it from you. Always make damn sure you're getting what you need in return.



Even though we have some TVs and radios there ain't much on. There's a radio station and a newspaper here but everything they say is a joke. Mostly we have rumors. I got it in my head that the USA was a green place where everything was better. I had a badass car and a pile of money but what I did not have was a home. So I'd saved up enough money to get back to the USA. You might be wondering how do we cross oceans. Boats motherfucker. It's dangerous and expensive and it takes forever but we do it. Maybe somecunt will do it in a plane again someday but I don't give a shit. I hate planes.

I had my life's savings in a big fucking heavy box in the passenger seat cuz I was headed to this place called Exotic Travels where you can buy a ticket to the USA. It was six hours west of Sydney and it's scary driving around with all that money but it's usually ok as long as nobody knows what you got. Problem is people know that if you're gonna buy a ticket across an ocean you must have something of value on you to buy it with. So there's a "police" roadblock out near Exotic Travels. They ain't real police. But your police ain't real neither. Police are just assholes with guns.

Anyway you can pull up and pay their toll but that toll is so much that if I paid it I wouldn't be able to afford my ticket.

You're probably hoping that this is where the action begins. But action ain't my goal. Shouldn't be your goal either. If I'd been a rock-n-roller who craved action my story would have been over a long time ago. I just wanted to be left alone with a shred of dignity. And to make it back to the USA. And to fix up my car and have a girlfriend or two. Ok maybe I did want a few things and maybe it was gonna take some action to get them but I sure as hell was not looking forward to that.

I paid some motherfucker to go through the roadblock ahead of me to distract the assholes while I drove around. They caught him and sliced him up. Good thing I only paid half in advance.

I made it to Exotic Travels. This place had a wall around it with snipers and shit. These cunts had money. If you have something of value you have to hide it or defend it. Especially if you settle down in one place. They made me show them my box of money and they let me in.

I dragged my big heavy box into the main building. The ticket counter kinda reminded me of a shitty airport. I hate airports.

There was a big sign that said NO REFUNDS. I dumped my life savings onto the counter. I made it clear to the cunt in charge that this ticket was for me and my car. I wasn't gonna leave my Firebird. The cunt gave me a special gold coin that was my ticket. He said no refunds. Yeah I got that. And he said the boat leaves with or without me. Fine.

He pointed out the window at a weird kid who was getting into an old Beetle. He told me that kid was a messenger who'd come find me in a few weeks and he'd let me know when and where the boat would be waiting. 

It all sounds sketchy as hell and I normally wouldn't have trusted it but I was there cuz these cunts had a sparkling reputation. I put the golden maguffin in my pocket and got the fuck out of there. 

I asked one of them cunts that was standing around if he'd run blocker for me in return for the few bucks I had left. "People like you is why we overbook" he said.

Messenger Kid was leaving in that Beetle and I figured he must have some way through the roadblock so I followed him out.

Before he got to the roadblock he came up on a mystery girl on the side of the road hitchhiking. He stopped so I did too. I kept my distance. He let Mystery Girl in and she hid in the back seat. Then he took off and continued in the direction the roadblock.

Roadblock was two police cars. One facing toward us. One facing away. Two blokes. A fake cop and an old geezer with a mohawk.

When Messenger Kid got there they just waved him by. Maybe Exotic Travels and the roadblockers are in cahoots. Or maybe the roadblockers just know better than to mess with the cunts who are bringing in the money.

I was hoping to turn around and give it some more thought but they spotted me. I could see them pointing and yelling. Exotic Travels wasn't gonna let me back in. I take pride in using my brain to solve shit like this but I didn't have time to come up with some big plan. All I could think of was to go around them and power through it. So I guess it's time for some action. I hope you motherfuckers enjoy it. You think I survived to tell this fucking story but for all you know I'm paralyzed from the neck down or maybe I'm some kind of ghost. Let's find out.

You can drive around their roadblock through the dirt and yeah I was gonna have to do that. But it slows you down and it's really risky. One time I was driving through dirt and I hit some kind of spikey bush thing and got four flat tires. If you get a flat tire you are gonna have to stop and get out of your car and then it all goes to shit.

So yeah I drove at them really fucking fast and veered into the dirt. The shocks were topping out and everything was shaking like crazy but the Firebird held together. 

Old Mohawk Guy couldn't get his shitty car started so he got out. He got a real good look at me and my car going by. And he froze. 

"That's my car Little Shit!" he shouted.

Yeah it was the terrorist that killed my family. I reminded him at the top of my lungs "Attachment leads to suffering!" Decades later he's still hung up on that car. I'd had that car longer than he ever did so the universe clearly wanted me to have it.

Fake Cop didn't have any trouble starting up his fake police car. He turned on his fake sirens and got on my tail. I got back on the road and kicked it in the guts. I put a couple kays between us but I was low on fuel and I had to blow right by the servo I'd planned to stop at. 

Then because life can never be simple I started catching up to Messenger Kid and Mystery Girl in that Volkswagen.

I was just gonna pass them but Mystery Girl was freaking out thinking I was coming to fuck with her. She leaned out the window and pointed a big fucking gun at me so I hit the brakes. She yelled out the window. "Lick my prickly flaps!"

I tried to get around them on the driver's side so she couldn't shoot me. Messenger Kid cut me off but then he lost control and went off the road and got stuck. I finally got past them and started laughing but then I ran out of gas.

I coasted to a stop and got out.

Messenger Kid hopped out of the Bug. He had a Bugs Bunny doll in his hand. He pulled a string on the doll and it said "Now take it easy!" Then he and Bugs bugged out in the direction of Exotic Travels.

Mystery Girl got out too and started strutting up the road toward me. I couldn't help but notice she was really good looking especially carrying that big gun. 

Or was it a gun? Nah it was just a big piece of pipe.

"That's not even a gun" I said.

She hit me in the face with the not gun and said "Your nads are gonna be me coin purse!"

I turned and tried to run. She jumped on me and started punching me. I'd never been punched by such a pretty girl before. She was really dirty but she smelled great. I tried to tell her there was an asshole chasing me and we needed to stop fighting and start hiding but it was hard to talk when she was punching me so much. 

Then we heard the fake sirens. The fake cop car came over the horizon. She ran and hid and left me there on the ground bleeding out my eyes.

I heard the cop car come to a stop inches away. The engine shut off. The door opened. I heard footsteps coming toward me. Fuck.

I felt a boot press against my throat. Then I heard a ringing sound. The boot left my throat. Then another ringing sound. It was the Mystery Girl's pipe!

She yelled "Kiss my dirt button!"

Then I heard a crunching sound. That was the cop's skull. And then I heard a thud.

She's pretty great when she's not punching you. She gave me an old Australian flag bandana to wipe the blood off my face. She introduced herself. "Mad Skelli."

"Firebird."

"Sorry I thought you were a friend of my ex."

"Who's your ex?"

She pointed at the dead guy. "He is."

"When did you break up?"

"Just now."

"Where you headed to?"

"Not headed to" she said. "Headed away."

So naturally I invited her to my place.



We spent the next few weeks together. Skelli didn't have any money so we did that traditional boy girl thing for a while. I paid for shit and she shopped and hunted and gathered and cooked and cleaned. 

I asked if we were dating. She said "I dunno I've never gotten this far. You're the first to survive the audition."

It was great but I'd spent my life's savings on that golden ticket in my pocket and Messenger Kid was bound to show up any day to tell me when I'd have to say goodbye. 

One day she was out getting food and I was fucking around on my skateboard. Because there's not much smooth concrete or asphalt around I'd converted my old skateboard into a dirtboard with tires instead of urethane wheels. It's hard as hell to push around on but it's fun to ride down hills. I was rolling around on it when I noticed Messenger Kid watching timidly from behind a wall.

I said "Hey Messenger Kid. Got a message for me?"

He came out. He had that bunny on him as always. He pulled its string. "What's up doc?" I couldn't tell if what it said was random or he'd figured out a way to make it say what he wanted it to say.

He handed me a note with the time and place on it. 9am at a dock here in Sydney. Pack tonight. Head out early. No problem.

I said to him "Want to give it a try?" I pointed at the skateboard.

He got on the board. He didn't know how to ride it and he was afraid to go downhill. So I got the idea to tie a rope around the front truck and pull him along. He managed to fall off anyway. He got back and on fell off probably ten more times.

Then he grabbed the rope and pointed at the board. I got on and let him pull me around.

We came up on a scary fucking pickup truck idling beside a little store and he got an idea. He started pointing at the trailer hitch.

I figured out what he was trying to tell me and I went up and ran the rope through the hitch and all the way back to the board. Then I wrapped it behind the front truck and held the end of the rope in my hand. That way I'd have something to hold on to when we took off. But there was no knot involved so if I let the rope go the board would just release itself from the hitch.

We sat on the curb behind the truck and waited. Acting innocent.

The motherfucker who owned the scary truck bolted out of that place and the store owner was yelling at him like maybe he'd just grabbed something.

He climbed into his truck. I stood up on the board and pulled the rope taut. Then he spun out and took off with me in tow.

For the first few seconds this idea of ours went great. Messenger Kid jumped up and down and lifted his fists in the air. 

I must have been going 50 kays when I hit a bump and I was like that Charger in the Dukes of Hazzard. 

Yeah I know all my pop culture references are from the 70s. Fuck you. It's cuz my world blew up. I know I said the 70s sucked but the TV and movies were great. Milton Friedman was on Donahue TWICE. That means after they did a daytime talk show where a Nobel prize winning economist blabbed on for an hour the producers got together and said that was fun and profitable and we should do it again. Mom made us sit down and watch it both times. The last movie I saw was The Cannonball Run. Did you know most of the shit in that movie really happened? Nobody in that movie gave a fuck. Nowadays nobody gives a fuck about anything because there's nothing to give a fuck about. But back in those days everyone was supposed to give a fuck and the coolest thing you could do was not give a fuck.

Anyway me and my skateboard flew into the air like that Charger in the Dukes of Hazzard. Only the board went one way and I went the other. I hit the ground and tumbled like I always do but at that speed you're gonna take some damage. I had on a t-shirt and jeans and by the time I stopped rolling there wasn't much left of that shirt.

We limped back to my place and Messenger Kid stitched me up. I noticed he was wearing a nice leather jacket and I figured I could use something like that. I asked where he got it. He kind of pulled on my arm and made a gesture with his head so I followed him.

We walked a few kays and ended up at an abandoned police station from back in the days when police where "real." We crawled through a broken window. I was hoping for guns or handcuffs but the only thing left that was worth a damn in that place was those leather jackets. But oh did I find the perfect jacket. You have to understand that in my world you rarely come upon the perfect anything. Mostly you just make do and adapt whatever you have. But this jacket fit me perfectly and looked just like the one from Easy fucking Rider.

I asked him "How do I look?" 

Messenger Kid pulled the string. "I like you."

"I like you too Messenger Kid."

It was getting dark when we got back. Skelli had dinner ready. She yelled "Messenger Kid!" and gave him a huge kiss. "Thanks for saving my life" she said. 

He pulled the string. "You're a cute bunny."

She turned to me and asked "How much longer do I have you for?"	

"I'm leaving tomorrow morning. Last night in Straya. We should go out."

Messenger Kid started walking away. I grabbed him and said "I meant all of us fuckface. I know some cunts who make ice cream."

So the three of us went to my garage. I opened the door and I wouldn't be recounting this with this level of detail if everything had gone as expected. I opened the door to my garage and my badass Firebird I'd owned for 25 years was gone. 

No one knew where I lived. No one knew there was a car in that garage.

"Fuck!" I looked over at Messenger Kid. "Did someone follow you?"

He shrugged.

There was no way anyone could have gotten that car started in less than an hour. I'd put in seven separate kill switches. I looked around. I looked down. Tire tracks. Big deep tire tracks. Their tires and mine. "Someone towed it."

Skelli sighed. "Mohawk Asshole has a tow truck."

"How well do you know that fucker?" I asked.

"I know where he lives."

"I know where he lives too. Or at least where he likes to hang out and harass innocent travelers. Six hours away... at speed."

"You have to be back here...." 

I checked my dad's old dive watch. It was 9pm. "In 12 hours."

I looked at Messenger Kid. "We're taking your car. I'm driving. I owe you both an ice cream."

We all squeezed into Messenger Kid's Bug and headed west. I put my foot to the floor and we proceeded at... checking the speedo.... fuck... 100 kays. It was dark but I kept the lights off in case we caught up to that fucker. I drove by the light of the moon and by feel.

Six hours later we did catch up to him. And there was my precious Firebird facing backward and chained helplessly to his truck. His truck was a loud and slow Loadmaster from the 40s. His lights were on but they were dim as fuck. He hadn't spotted us even though we were right up on him. It was too dark and that V8 was too noisy. His rearview was blocked by the Bird.

"Skelli you drive. I'll climb into the Firebird. Messenger Kid you hop on the truck and let down the chain real slow."

They both turned to me and shook their heads.

"I'll owe you both TWO ice creams."

They looked at each other and paused. They shrugged and nodded. 

So here's some more of that damn action you crave. I'm glad you find it so entertaining when my life is in danger. This book had better make me big money. Maybe a movie deal when somecunt gets movies working again.

I climbed out the window of the Bug. Suddenly this did not seem like such a good plan. But I made it in through the window of the Firebird. I put on my seat belt. I put my keys in the ignition and unlocked the wheel and put it in neutral. I was now in my car pointed downward at a 45 degree angle with the rear wheels off the ground rolling backward at something like 80 kays.

Messenger Kid climbed out of the Bug and onto the truck. That kid ain't as timid as he seems. He just knows when to run and when to hide and when to jump on the back of a fucking truck.

Messenger Kid slowly turned the crank. The Firebird's back wheels inched closer to the roadway.

At this point it's worth reminding you fucks that it was three in the morning.

Mohawk Asshole was falling asleep at the wheel. I know this because we started casually drifting off the road and heading for a big fucking tree. My eyes got real big because I did not like this situation. Messenger Kid started cranking furiously and a moment later all four of the Firebird's wheels were on the ground. The Firebird suddenly became a four-wheeled trailer and a four-wheeled trailer does not track. Tires were screeching and vehicles were fishtailing and we were still chained together. I pressed as hard as I could on the brake pedal and Messenger Kid jumped off the truck and rolled. Mohawk Asshole's truck bumped into the tree and crunched its radiator. The chain had just enough slack in it that the Firebird's ass came to a stop a couple centimeters from the back of the tow truck.

I started up my badass Firebird and tried to get loose. Its tires were spinning. Smoke was everywhere. Mohawk Asshole was awake and getting out of his truck. 

Skelli turned the Bug around and shouted "Come on you nerds!"

Messenger Kid ran to the back of the Firebird. I put it in reverse and relieved the tension in the chain. Messenger Kid got the chain unhooked and jumped into the window of the Firebird. Mohawk Asshole grabbed his leg as we were driving away but all he got was Messenger Kid's shoe. Messenger Kid wants his shoe back asshole.

We drove a few kays down the road and pulled over. The Bug was not going to make it back to Sydney in time. We'd be lucky if the Trans Am did. And Messenger Kid had places to be and a job to do. 

We shared a group hug. Messenger Kid limped into his Bug and closed the door. He pulled the string on the bunny. I was expecting "Now take it easy" but what I got was "Hey take me with you." The Bug sputtered away.

Skelli and I got in the Bird. "Eastbound and down" I said. We flew back toward Sydney at 200 kays. 

The sun came up and we were getting close. I looked down at my dad's watch but discovered it had been smashed during last night's action. 

"Fuck." I took it off and tossed it out the window.

When we got to the dock the boat was there but it was already moving. No refunds. The boat leaves with or without me. 

The boat was leaving without me.

I kept on it. It looked like there was less than a meter between the dock and the boat. Ok maybe more than a meter. But I'd seen the Dukes of Hazzard. I'd seen Smokey and the Bandit. I kicked it in the guts. We hopped over the gap. We almost killed a few of the passengers and boat driving cunts but they all managed get the fuck out of our way. I hit the brakes and screeched to a stop. Maintain your brakes and you'll live long enough to appreciate your engine.

We stepped out of my badass car and some little tyke said "That was awesome."

Damn right it was kid. We don't got movie stars so I'm all you've got.

I gave one of them boat driving cunts my golden coin. But Skelli had to go.

"Bloody goodbyes suck" she said.

I missed the fuck out of her the moment she jumped off the boat. She swam back to the dock. She climbed out of the water and said "I love you."

"Attachment leads to suffering" I said.

"I hope you get scurvy" she shouted.
