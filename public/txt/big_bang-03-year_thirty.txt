I spent a few years outside LA repairing stuff and driving for people while I worked on my portable computer in my spare time. When I'd saved up enough I figured I should head back to New Jersey. I had no idea what I'd find but I had to find out. I think some part of me thought that Mom Dad and Sis would all be there waiting and it would be 1982 again.

Joshua trees. The Grand Canyon. Saguaros. Monument Valley. Arches. Natural bridges. Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner. Meep meep motherfucker. Plymouth paid Warner Brothers big money to license that bird. Going faster miles an hour. With the radio on.

All the cities were fucked. Cunts heard me coming and emerged from the rubble to flag me down and offer me petrol at exorbitant prices. I happily paid those prices. If they had charged reasonable prices then everyone would have been driving across the country and there would have been no fuel left.

The world will never run out of anything. I guarantee it.

For example. If we ever start to run out of oil those cunts that sell it will raise the price until people stop paying it. People will put electric motors in their cars and charge their cars with windmills because it will be cheaper. No one will want that expensive oil any more and we'll leave it in the ground. 

Even if you force someone to sell oil at a low price and customers are lined up out the door we won't run out of it. They'll go out of business because their costs will be too high and their profit will be nonexistent. Oh there would definitely be shortages but a shortage has nothing to do with the world running out of something. A shortage just means that thing you want is really far away and hard to get at.

We will never run out of anything.

Radio breaks the rule of supply and demand. Radio is free. The radio kept me going. It kept me going when I had no money. It kept me going when I had no petrol. It kept me going when I had no food. It kept me going when I had no water. If I'd had no air I would have breathed the music.

I don't know how it was possible but there was someone on the radio on every goddamn kilometer of Route 66. The whole country was gone and yet dozens of people in remote outposts spent all day and night telling stories to the void and playing records for no one.

When I was a kid I recorded stuff off the radio because I couldn't afford the records. I'd be pissed when the DJ would walk all over the beginnings and endings of my tunes. One time I got a record for my birthday but I still listened to the tape because I missed the DJ's voice.

I was cannonballing through Holbrook AZ when a DJ saved my life.

"You're listening to the Spirit of 66. Chicago to LA come get your fix. Chicago to NYC. ABC to XYZ. Follow us all the way home. Coast to coast proof you're never alone. Move to LA. Learn to surf. 24 hours a day till the sun swallows the earth. Shut up and listen I got what you've been missing. What you need to know is stay the fuck away from the bridge where 66 crosses the Rio Grande. That's your wrong turn at Albuquerque right there. I'm The Swede and I've got what you need. This is Rush with Spirit of Radio."

Of salesmen. Of salemen. OF SALESMEN! I sang as loud as I could and danced in the seat and made it to Texas by morning. 



Every goddamn creature that is capable of locomotion needs to be able to remember how to get from place to place. How to find the way back to that spot where there was water. How to avoid that spot where there was a bear. It's what we share with the cockroach. It's why when you need to remember a list you can just imagine each item sitting in a room in your childhood home. Later when you need to recall the list you just imagine walking through your home and seeing those items in each room.

I remembered the way.
