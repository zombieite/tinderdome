[Firebird]

Joshua trees. Saguaros. The Grand Canyon. Monument Valley. Arches and natural bridges. Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner. Meep meep. Plymouth paid Warner Brothers big bucks to license that bird. Going faster miles an hour. With the radio on.

The radio is what kept me going. It kept me going when there was no money. It kept me going when there was no petrol. It kept me going when there was no food. It kept me going when there was no water. If there had been no air I would have just breathed through the radio.

I don't know how it was possible but there was something on the radio across every goddamn centimeter of the country. Imagine being in the middle of nowhere spending energy and time telling stories to the void and playing records for no one. Why did they do it day in and day out?

Finally a voice like a slow motion Wolfman Jack explained it to me. "You're listening to the Spirit of 66. Chicago to LA we got your fix. From Chicago to NYC. From ABC to XYZ. Follow us all the way home. Coast to coast proof you're never alone. Come to LA. Learn to surf. 24 hours a day till the sun swallows the earth. I'm The Swede and I've got what you need. Shut up and listen I got what you've been missing. Next up is Rush Spirit of Radio."

The USA was not a green place. Not any more.

Every goddamn creature that is capable of locomotion needs to be able to remember how to get from place to place. How to find the way back to that spot where there was water. How to avoid that spot where there was a bear. It's what we share with the cockroach. It's why when you need to remember a list you can just imagine each item sitting in a room in your childhood home. Later when you need to recall the list you just imagine walking through your home and seeing those items in each room.

I remembered the way.
