Route 66. Joshua trees. The Grand Canyon. Saguaros. Monument Valley. Arches. Natural bridges. Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner. Meep meep motherfucker. Plymouth paid Warner Brothers big money to license that bird. Going faster miles an hour. With the radio on.

I'd never seen any of this shit. Looked just as good after the Big Bang as it had before. Better. No tourists. Hell is other tourists.

The cities were smashed but cunts heard me coming and emerged from the rubble to flag me down and offer me petrol at high prices which I happily paid. If they had charged reasonable prices then everyone would have been driving across the country and there would have been no fuel left.

The world will never run out of anything. I guarantee it.

Take oil. If we ever start to run out of oil the cunts that sell it will raise the price until people stop paying it. No one will want that expensive oil anymore and we'll leave it in the ground. People will put electric motors in their cars and charge their cars with windmills. Not a bad idea.

High prices don't stay high for long. High prices are a signal to all the clever cunts in the world that this is a good business to go into. They go into that business and they increase competition and prices come down naturally.

Even if you force someone to sell oil at a low price and customers are lined up out the door we won't run out of it. They'll go out of business because their costs will be too high and their profit will be nonexistent. In that case there would definitely be shortages but a shortage has nothing to do with the world running out of something. A shortage just means that thing you want is really far away and hard to get.

I don't know how it was possible but there was someone on the radio on every goddamn kilometer of Route 66. Civilization was gone and yet dozens of people in remote outposts spent all day and night telling stories to the void and playing records for no one.

Radio breaks the law of supply and demand. Once the signal leaves that antenna radio is free. Like knowledge. And fire. If you share your radio or your knowledge or your fire with me nobody loses and everybody wins. Listening to the radio isn't like taking a slice of a pie. Everyone who listens to the radio gets their own damn pie. 

The radio kept me going. It kept me going when I had no money. It kept me going when I had no petrol. It kept me going when I had no food. It kept me going when I had no water. If I'd had no air I would have breathed the music.

When I was a kid I recorded stuff from the radio because I couldn't afford the records. I'd be pissed when the DJ walked all over the beginnings and endings of my tunes. But one time I got a record for my birthday. Heart of Glass. When I played the record I missed hearing the DJ's voice.

I was cannonballing through Holbrook AZ when a DJ saved my life.

"You're listening to Uranium Springs Radio" he said. "Get your fix on Route 66. Follow us all the way home. Coast to coast proof you're never alone. Shut up and listen I've got what you're missing. Here's the news. Stay away from the crossroads in Gallup New Mexico. That's your wrong turn at Albuquerque right there. There's a party going on that you do not want to crash. Go dark go quiet and go at night. Take the side streets. Now back to the music. This is Rush. Spirit of Radio. I'm The Swede and I've got what you need."

I sang along as loud as I could and bounced in the seat. "Of salesmen. Of salemen. OF SALESMEN!"

When I closed in on Gallup I stopped and waited for night to fall. I turned off the headlights and took side streets through town.

It was immediately clear what intersection he was talking about. An overpass came into view. Chockablock with assholes frolicking about playing Twister and burning cars and shit. They were doing bad things to people who I hoped deserved it but who I suspected did not.

Thanks for the tip Swede.



Every goddamn creature that is capable of locomotion needs to be able to remember how to get from place to place. How to find the way back to that spot where there was water. How to avoid that spot where there was a bear. It's what we share with the cockroach and the mouse and the fish and the dinosaurs. It's why when you need to remember a list there's a trick you can use where you imagine each item sitting in a room in your childhood home. Later when you need to recall the list you just imagine walking through the house and seeing those items in each room.

New Jersey.

It had been 30 years but I remembered the way. Maybe Mom and Dad and Sis would all be there waiting and it would be 1981 and we could start over.

It was a dark night with no moon. I wasn't going to sneak into a house at night. I camped out in a wooded area by our house where I used to try to take my bike over jumps.

The sun woke me up. I opened my eyes and got out of the car. 

The trees were blackened stalks. Everything had been burned down long ago. Everything was gone. The entire neighborhood. Trees and telephone poles and houses and mailboxes and flowerbeds. The charred remnants were overgrown with weeds.

I walked to my old house. What used to be my house. What used to be my home.

I noticed Dad's safe sitting half obscured in the brush. Dad had kept silver bars in it. The door had been removed and the silver was gone.

All that was left in the safe was a reel of Super 8 film. The fire hadn't gotten it but the elements had. It crumbled in my hands. I held a piece up to the sky but couldn't discern what was on it.
