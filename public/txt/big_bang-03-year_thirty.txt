[Firebird]

Joshua trees. Saguaros. The Grand Canyon. Monument Valley. Arches and natural bridges. Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner. Meep meep. Plymouth paid Warner Brothers big money to license that bird. Going faster miles an hour. With the radio on.

All of the cities were fucked. Cunts heard me coming and emerged from the rubble to flag me down and offer supplies at exorbitant prices. I happily paid those prices because those prices were much better than death.

But the radio was free. The radio is what kept me going. It kept me going when I had no money. It kept me going when I had no petrol. It kept me going when I had no food. It kept me going when I had no water. If I'd had no air I would have used the antenna like a snorkel.

I don't know how it was possible but there was something on the radio across every goddamn centimeter of the country. Imagine dozens of people in remote outposts spending energy and time telling stories to the void and playing records for no one.

One night I was cannonballing through east nowhere New Mexico at 1am because I'd been told it wasn't safe to travel through there in the daylight. I was nodding off but I couldn't stop because I'd wake up dead in no man's land.

A voice that sounded like a slow motion Wolfman Jack cascaded over the opening chords of Spirit of Radio by Rush. A great DJ sounds so good over the music that you miss their voice when you play the record without them. "You're listening to the Spirit of 66. Chicago to LA come get your fix. Chicago to NYC. ABC to XYZ. Follow us all the way home. Coast to coast proof you're never alone. Move to LA. Learn to surf. 24 hours a day till the sun swallows the earth. I'm The Swede and I've got what you need. Shut up and listen I got what you've been missing."

Of salesmen. Of salemen. OF SALESMEN! I sang as loud as I could and danced in the seat and made it to Texas by morning. 



Every goddamn creature that is capable of locomotion needs to be able to remember how to get from place to place. How to find the way back to that spot where there was water. How to avoid that spot where there was a bear. It's what we share with the cockroach. It's why when you need to remember a list you can just imagine each item sitting in a room in your childhood home. Later when you need to recall the list you just imagine walking through your home and seeing those items in each room.

I remembered the way.
