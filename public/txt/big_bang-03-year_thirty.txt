Route 66. Joshua trees. The Grand Canyon. Saguaros. Monument Valley. Arches. Natural bridges. Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner. Meep meep motherfucker. Plymouth paid Warner Brothers big money to license that bird. Going faster miles an hour. With the radio on.

I'd never seen any of this shit. Looked just as good after the Big Bang as it had before. Better. No tourists.

The cities were smashed but cunts heard me coming and emerged from the rubble to flag me down and offer me petrol at exorbitant prices. I happily paid those prices. If they had charged reasonable prices then everyone would have been driving across the country and there would have been no fuel left.

The world will never run out of anything. I guarantee it.

Take oil for example. If we ever start to run out of oil those cunts that sell it will raise the price until people stop paying it. People will put electric motors in their cars and charge their cars with windmills. No one will want that expensive oil anymore and we'll leave it in the ground. 

Even if you force someone to sell oil at a low price and customers are lined up out the door we won't run out of it. They'll go out of business because their costs will be too high and their profit will be nonexistent. In that case there would definitely be shortages but a shortage has nothing to do with the world running out of something. A shortage just means that thing you want is really far away and hard to make or dig up or whatever.

The world will never run out of anything.

Radio breaks the rule of supply and demand. Radio is free. 

The radio kept me going. It kept me going when I had no money. It kept me going when I had no petrol. It kept me going when I had no food. It kept me going when I had no water. If I'd had no air I would have breathed the music.

I don't know how it was possible but there was someone on the radio on every goddamn kilometer of Route 66. Civilization was gone and yet dozens of people in remote outposts spent all day and night telling stories to the void and playing records for no one.

When I was a kid I recorded stuff off the radio because I couldn't afford the records. I'd be pissed when the DJ would walk all over the beginnings and endings of my tunes. One time I got a record for my birthday. Heart of Glass. But when I played the record sometimes I missed hearing the DJ's voice over it.

I was cannonballing through Holbrook AZ when a DJ saved my life.

"You're listening to Uranium Springs Radio. Get your fix on Route 66. Follow us all the way home. Coast to coast proof you're never alone. Shut up and listen I've got what you've been missing. Here's the news. Stay away from the crossroads in Gallup New Mexico. That's your wrong turn at Albuquerque right there. There is a party going on that you do not want to be invited to. Take the side streets. Go dark and go quiet and go at night. Back to the music. This is Rush with Spirit of Radio. I'm The Swede and I've got what you need."

"Of salesmen. Of salemen. OF SALESMEN!" I sang as loud as I could and danced in the seat.

When I closed in on Gallup I stopped and waited for nightfall. I turned off the headlights and took side streets through town.

It was immediately clear what intersection he was talking about. An overpass came into view. Chockablock with assholes frolicking about playing Twister and burning cars and shit. They were doing bad things to people who I hoped deserved it but who I suspected did not. As I quietly idled by the whole damn bridge came down before my eyes. In that moment a hundred people must have died. I'll never forget that image. Thanks for the tip Swede.



Every goddamn creature that is capable of locomotion needs to be able to remember how to get from place to place. How to find the way back to that spot where there was water. How to avoid that spot where there was a bear. It's what we share with the cockroach. It's why when you need to remember a list there's a trick you can use where you imagine each item sitting in a room in your childhood home. Later when you need to recall the list you just imagine walking through the house and seeing those items in each room.

It had been 30 years but I remembered the way. Maybe Mom and Dad and Sis would all be there waiting and it would be 1982 again.
