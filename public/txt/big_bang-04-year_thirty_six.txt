Wasteland Weekend? Spoiled motherfuckers. My life is not your theme park.

You fuckers with your anxiety and your depression. The impala overcomes its chronic fatigue syndrome as the lion approaches. I'm a goddamn impala every goddamn day. You don't know how good you have it. Clean water. Enough food to make everyone obese. Airplanes. Skyscrapers. Cell phones. The motherfucking internet.



It was time again for the Gathering. It had been a year since John pissed off Skelli and 11 years since I'd last seen her. I didn't think she'd gone back to Australia but I had no way of knowing. I figured I'd never see her again. Sure I'd been with other girls but you never forget the first girl who tries to murder you. Any girl can tell you you're a sociopath but I missed hearing it from Skelli because she always said it so eloquently.

I hadn't traded places with John since the last Gathering. I had no idea if it would happen again.

We come to the Gathering find thems we're looking for and thems we've lost. People come from all over the world. It's not an easy search. There's enough people there you might spend the whole week looking and not run into them. You gotta ask around and everyone you ask you gotta make into a friend who'll ask around for you too.
