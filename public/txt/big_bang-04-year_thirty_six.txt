It was time once again for the Gathering. It had been a year and I hadn't found Skelli. I didn't think she'd gone back to Australia but I had no way of knowing. 

I hadn't traded places with John since the last Gathering. I had no idea if it would happen again. I was kind of hoping it would and kind of hoping it wouldn't.

We come to the Gathering find thems we're looking for and thems we've lost. People come from all over the world. It's not an easy search. There's enough people there you might spend the whole week looking and not run into them. You gotta ask around and everyone you ask you gotta make into a friend who'll ask around for you too.
