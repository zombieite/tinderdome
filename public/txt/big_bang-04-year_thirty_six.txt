Wasteland Weekend? Spoiled motherfuckers. My life is not your theme park.

You fuckers with your anxiety and your depression. The impala overcomes its chronic fatigue syndrome as the lion approaches. I'm a goddamn impala every goddamn day. You don't know how good you have it. Clean water. Enough food to make everyone obese. Airplanes. Skyscrapers. Cell phones. The motherfucking internet.

It had been a year since my girlfriend had last seen "me" and 11 years since I'd last seen her. I figured I'd never see her again. Sure I'd been with other girls but you never forget the first girl who tries to murder you. Any girl can tell you you're a sociopath but I missed hearing it from Skelli because she always said it in such a colorful way.

I hadn't traded places with John since the last Gathering. I had no idea if it would happen again this year.

One good thing that came from meeting John was getting a chance to see them little phone computers they have in Tomorrowmorrowland. When I was there I did some research and got heaps of ideas. Over the past year I'd made some improvements to my Firebox and painstakingly built ten more of them by hand to sell at this year's Gathering. Like that time I bought a ticket across the ocean I'd gone all in on this. I was out of money.

A Firebox wasn't as small as the little phones in Tomorrowmorrowland but it was a giant leap of progress from those punch card machines that took up a whole room. You could carry it around if you were sufficiently motivated to. You could hook it up to a TV set and a walkie talkie and a modified typewriter and bam not only would you have your own computer but you'd be on a motherfucking network that didn't use any wires. Or at least you would be if there was anyone else around to be on the network with. It used a lot of power so it was expensive to run. But hell you could power it with a bicycle if you wanted. Now that I'd seen them phones I knew for sure I was on the right track.

At the Gathering I made a point to park in the same spot as I had the year before. I figured maybe that spot was a portal to another dimension or something. It worked. Me and John traded places again.

It wasn't the spot that was magic. The magic happened any time we occupied the same space. The Gathering and Wasteland Weekend both happened at the same place in the California desert and we'd both chosen the same parking spot.

Being a pair of clever cunts we immediately started using this newfound superpower to our advantage.
 
This time we spent a few days in each others' worlds. I could tell John felt bad about what he did to me and Skelli because when I returned from partying at Wasteland I discovered that John had spent his time bringing out the glory of the Firebox.

John didn't have to think up the ideas himself. He just reimplemented ideas that were successful in his timeline. On day one of the internet we were gonna be bigger than Microsoft and Apple and Facebook combined. There would be some competition. The whole internet would be free and you could build whatever you wanted on it. But only we had a foolproof way of picking the winners. Everyone else would have to use trial and error. We'd be Google and you'd be Ask Jeeves.

John built a social network called You Are Awaited that would let you stay in touch with other people and meet new people too. Maybe someday even people all over the world. That would be dependent on everyone having a network connection but if we got enough people with Fireboxes living reasonably close together the wireless network could build itself and repair itself and keep itself alive indefinitely.

But the social network was nothing compared to the other thing that he did. He designed a cryptocurrency and a mining program that would let the Firebox print its own money. It would create Firebucks out of nothing but electricity and math. He made the Firebuck miner an integral part of the computer's software so that everyone who bought a Firebox would have an instant revenue stream and the Firebox would pay for itself.

The best part was that John gave my Firebox a massive head start on generating Firebucks so that I'd be the richest person on the planet. I'd have literally all the money in the world and you'd be super excited about pedaling your bike for an hour to get a 20 cent piece. Hey 20 cents is better than no fucking cents.

This would only work if we could get everyone to accept Firebucks as money. If.

Step one would be selling the first Firebox.

It should have been easy to sell a box that produces money and friends. But the thing would only work if other people would accept that money and be your friend. So the first few sales were the hardest.

I guess I should say the first few sales were impossible because they didn't happen. No one bought one. I told people I'd sell them stuff I owned in return for the Firebucks they generated with their boxes. Problem was I didn't own anything.

(Maybe john sells the clothes off his back except hat and jacket. Maybe he sells/loans Deadline his car. Maybe that's why he attracts Mohawk Asshole's attention and then John has to hide him).
