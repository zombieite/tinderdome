Wasteland Weekend? Spoiled motherfuckers. My life is not your theme park.

You fuckers with your anxiety and your depression. The impala overcomes its chronic fatigue syndrome as the lion approaches. I'm a goddamn impala every goddamn day. You don't know how good you have it. Clean water. Abundant food. Airplanes. Skyscrapers. Cell phones. The motherfucking internet.

I got out of my badass car and went looking for Skelli. At that point me and John stopped trading places and that was a good thing since it was downright impressive how much John had fucked up my life in such a short amount of time.

I hadn't seen Skelli in ten years and now I might never see her again. Sure I'd been with other girls but you never forget the first girl who tries to murder you. Any girl can tell you you're an asshole or a sociopath. But I missed hearing it from Skelli because she always said it so much more eloquently.

It was time again for the Gathering. It had been a year and I hadn't found Skelli. I didn't think she'd gone back to Australia but I had no way of knowing. 

I hadn't traded places with John since the last Gathering. I had no idea if it would happen again. I was kind of hoping it would and kind of hoping it wouldn't.

We come to the Gathering find thems we're looking for and thems we've lost. People come from all over the world. It's not an easy search. There's enough people there you might spend the whole week looking and not run into them. You gotta ask around and everyone you ask you gotta make into a friend who'll ask around for you too.
