[Firebird]

Wasteland Weekend? Spoiled motherfuckers. My life is not your theme park.

You fuckers with your anxiety and your depression. The impala overcomes its chronic fatigue syndrome as the lion approaches. I'm a goddamn impala every goddamn day. You don't know how good you have it. Clean water. Enough food to make everyone obese. Airplanes. Skyscrapers. Cell phones. The motherfucking internet.

It had been a year since John fucked my girlfriend without proper consent and 11 years since I'd last seen her. I figured I'd never see her again. Sure I'd been with other girls but you never forget the first girl who tries to murder you. Any girl can tell you you're a sociopath but I missed hearing it from Skelli because she always said it in such a colorful way.

I hadn't traded places with John since the last Gathering. I had no idea if it would happen again this year. One good thing that came from meeting John was getting a chance to see them little phone computers they have in Tomorrowmorrowland. I'd already been working on building my own computers to sell to people so when I was in Tomorrowmorrowland I did some research and got heaps of ideas. I'd perfected my little Firebox that I was gonna sell to the world. It wasn't as small as the little phones in Tomorrowmorrowland but it was progress compared to those things that used to take up a whole room. You can hook it up to a TV set and a walkie talkie and a modified typewriter and bam not only do you have your own computer but you are on a motherfucking network that doesn't use any wires. Well you would be if there was anyone else around to be on a network with. The thing uses a lot of electricity so it's expensive to run. But now I've seen them phones and I know for sure I'm on the right track. And hell you can power the damn thing with a bicycle if you want.




everyone wants a firebox because it prints money, and the sooner you get in on it, the more money you get

john explains the principles of Firecoin

(They do trade places, john writes an OS and a Firecoin mining program installed by default to make the Firebox pay for itself and you are awaited (wasteland facebook))
