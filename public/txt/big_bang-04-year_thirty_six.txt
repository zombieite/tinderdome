Wasteland Weekend? Spoiled motherfuckers. My life is not your theme park.

You fuckers with your anxiety and your depression. The impala overcomes its chronic fatigue syndrome as the lion approaches. I'm a goddamn impala every goddamn day. You don't know how good you have it. Clean water. Enough food to make everyone obese. Airplanes. Skyscrapers. Cell phones. The motherfucking internet.



It was time again for the Gathering. It had been a year since John pissed off Skelli and 11 years since I'd last seen her. I figured I'd never see her again. Sure I'd been with other girls but you never forget the first girl who tries to murder you. Any girl can tell you you're a sociopath but I missed hearing it from Skelli because she always said it in such a colorful way.

I hadn't traded places with John since the last Gathering. I had no idea if it would happen again. I wasn't sure if I wanted it to happen again.

One good thing that came from meeting John was getting a chance to see those computers they have in Tomorrowmorrowland. I'd done a little research and gotten lots of ideas. I'd spent the past year perfecting my little box that I was gonna sell to the world.
