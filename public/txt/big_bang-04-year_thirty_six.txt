[Firebird]

Wasteland Weekend? Spoiled motherfuckers. My life is not your theme park.

You fuckers with your anxiety and your depression. The impala overcomes its chronic fatigue syndrome as the lion approaches. I'm a goddamn impala every goddamn day. You don't know how good you have it. Clean water. Enough food to make everyone obese. Airplanes. Skyscrapers. Cell phones. The motherfucking internet.

It had been a year since my girlfriend had last seen "me" but 11 years since I'd last seen her. I figured I'd never see her again. Sure I'd been with other girls but you never forget the first girl who tries to murder you. Any girl can tell you you're a sociopath but I missed hearing it from Skelli because she always said it in such a colorful way.

I hadn't traded places with John since the last Gathering. I had no idea if it would happen again this year.

One good thing that came from meeting John was getting a chance to see them little phone computers they have in Tomorrowmorrowland. When I was there I did some research and got heaps of ideas. Over the past year I'd made some improvements to my Firebox and painstakingly built ten more of them by hand to sell at this year's Gathering.

The Firebox wasn't as small as the little phones in Tomorrowmorrowland but it was a giant leap ahead from those punch card machines that took up a whole room. You could carry it around if you were sufficiently motivated. You could hook it up to a TV set and a walkie talkie and a modified typewriter and bam not only would you have your own computer but you'd be on a motherfucking network that didn't use any wires. It used a lot of power so it was expensive to run. But hell you could power it with a bicycle if you wanted. Now that I'd seen them phones I knew for sure I was on the right track.

At the Gathering I made a point to park in the same spot as I had the year before. I figured maybe that spot was a portal to another dimension or something. It worked. Me and John traded places again.

It wasn't the spot that was magic. The magic happened any time we occupied the same space. The Gathering and Wasteland Weekend both happened at the same place in the California desert and we'd both chosen the same parking spot.

Being a pair of clever cunts we immediately started using this newfound superpower to our advantage.
 
This time we spent more time in each others' worlds. I could tell John felt bad about what he did to me and Skelli because when I returned from partying at Wasteland I discovered that John had spent his time bringing out the glory of the Firebox.

John didn't have to think up the ideas himself. He just reimplemented ideas that were successful in his timeline. On day one of the internet we were gonna be bigger than Microsoft and Apple and Facebook combined. Those are some really successful companies for those those of you who don't know. There would be some competition. The whole network would be free and you could build whatever you wanted on it. But only we had a foolproof way of picking the winners. Everyone else would have to use trial and error. We'd be Google and you'd be Ask Jeeves. I don't know what that means either but that's how John described it.

John built a "social network" called You Are Awaited that would let you stay in touch with friends and make new friends too. But the social network was nothing compared to the other thing that he did.

John designed a "cryptocurrency" and a "mining" program that would let the Firebox print its own money. It would create Firebucks out of nothing but electricity and math. Everyone who bought a Firebox would have an instant revenue stream and the Firebox would pay for itself.

The best part was that John gave my Firebox a massive head start on generating Firebucks so that I'd be the richest person on the planet. I'd have literally all the money in the world and you'd be super excited about pedaling your bike for an hour to get a 20 cent piece. Hey 20 cents is better than no fucking cents so fuck you. Yes I am making the world a better place no matter what you say.

This would only work if we could get everyone to accept Firebucks. The only way we'd get everyone to accept Firebucks would be if everyone had a few Firebucks to spend. The only way everyone would have a few Firebucks to spend would be if everyone had a Firebox.

So step one would be selling the first ten Fireboxes. It should have been easy to sell a box that produces money and friends. But the thing would only work if lots of other people had boxes too. No one was buying.

We were going to have to advertise. I decided to go see the cunt that ran the local paper. Went by the name of Deadline.

I pulled up in front of his tiny office building in my rumbling V8. Deadline popped his head out to get a look at my badass car. I strutted up to him confidently and introduced myself. 

"How many eyeballs does your paper reach?" I asked.

"Eight thousand" he said. He was still gawking at my car.

"That's over four thousand people" I replied. Perfect.

I tried to pitch him the idea of doing an article on the Firebox but he wasn't having it. He said he'd be happy to sell me an ad. But I'd gone all in on building ten of these fancy high tech boxes so I was totally broke. I had nothing to offer.

Except.

Fuck.

I was 100% sure the Firebox could change the world. The question was would other people realize that too? Was I willing to bet everything?

The reward was worth the risk. 

No way I was gonna sell my car. But what I would do was bet my car.

I told Deadline he could have my car if he gave me an ad in every paper from now until forever. But if he ever wanted to publish a story about the Firebox he'd have to give me that car back first.

Today we were small enough to need advertising. Tomorrow we'd be big enough to be news.

We shook on it. I handed him the keys.

Deadline was kind enough to throw in a 40 year old box of Twinkies but I was afraid to eat them. That night I slept under the stars on top of a pile of Fireboxes.



We sold five.

The Gathering was coming to an end. We were fucked.

Nah I'm just fucking with you. I thought we were fucked until I figured out what to do with the other five Fireboxes.

I'd have John research the lives of our five customers' doppelgangers in his timeline and see if they had friends or spouses or whatever in Tomorrowmorrowland that they didn't have in Epoxyclypse. I'd give away the last five boxes to those people in this timeline. They'd all get in touch with each other on the You Are Awaited social network and they'd hit it off and we'd have five pairs of happy people that would be shouting to the world about how great the Firebox was.

Need to:
Explain that our plan worked
Get interview in paper
Get car back
Explain that the interview and the happy customers got us a bunch of back orders
Maybe find out manuscript was read or stolen
Find out Deadline is missing

I stopped in to say goodbye to Deadline because he was one cool cat. But his office was trashed. His boss was there. A guy known as The Swede. He told me Deadline had gone missing.

I looked around. There were "clues" all over. An unpublished article about the weird sex practices of a local tribe. Photos connected nonsensically by strings on a bulletin board. A Twinkie on a chair. None of it made any sense but I promised Swede I'd do whatever I could.
