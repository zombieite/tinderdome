[Firebird]

Wasteland Weekend? Spoiled motherfuckers. My life is not your theme park.

You fuckers with your anxiety and your depression. The impala overcomes its chronic fatigue syndrome as the lion approaches. I'm a goddamn impala every goddamn day. You don't know how good you have it. Clean water. Enough food to make everyone obese. Airplanes. Skyscrapers. Cell phones. The motherfucking internet.

It had been a year since John fucked my girlfriend without proper consent and 11 years since I'd last seen her. I figured I'd never see her again. Sure I'd been with other girls but you never forget the first girl who tries to murder you. Any girl can tell you you're a sociopath but I missed hearing it from Skelli because she always said it in such a colorful way.

I hadn't traded places with John since the previous Gathering. I had no idea if it would happen again this year.

One good thing that came from meeting John was getting a chance to see them little phone computers they have in Tomorrowmorrowland. I'd already been working on building my own miniature computer so when I was in Tomorrowmorrowland I did some research and got heaps of ideas.

My Firebox wasn't as small as the little phones in Tomorrowmorrowland but it was progress compared to those punch card machines that used to take up a whole room. You could hook it up to a TV set and a walkie talkie and a modified typewriter and bam not only would you have your own computer but you'd be on a motherfucking network that didn't use any wires. Or at least you would be if there was anyone else around to be on a network with. It used a lot of power so it was expensive to run. But hell you could power it with a bicycle if you wanted. Now that I'd seen them phones I knew for sure I was on the right track.

At the Gathering I made a point to park in the same spot as I had the year before. I figured maybe that spot was a portal to another dimension or something. It worked. We traded places again.

We figured out that it wasn't that spot that was magic. The magic happened any time we occupied the same space. The Gathering and Wasteland Weekend both happened at the same place in the California desert and we'd both chosen the same parking spot.

Being a pair of clever cunts we immediately started using this newfound superpower to our advantage.
 
 
 


everyone wants a firebox because it prints money, and the sooner you get in on it, the more money you get

john explains the principles of Firecoin

(They do trade places, john writes an OS and a Firecoin mining program installed by default to make the Firebox pay for itself and you are awaited (wasteland facebook))

firebird becomes richest person on earth, overnight

(next comes games and MOVIES (including the movie of THIS story) and ebay and etsy)

firebird promptly switches over to paying people to make fireboxes
