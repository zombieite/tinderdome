Wasteland Weekend? Spoiled motherfuckers. My life is not your theme park.

You fuckers with your anxiety and your depression. The impala overcomes its chronic fatigue syndrome as the lion approaches. I'm a goddamn impala every goddamn day. You don't know how good you have it. Clean water. Enough food to make everyone obese. Airplanes. Skyscrapers. Cell phones. The motherfucking internet.

It had been a year since John fucked my girlfriend without proper consent and 11 years since I'd last seen her. I figured I'd never see her again. Sure I'd been with other girls but you never forget the first girl who tries to murder you. Any girl can tell you you're a sociopath but I missed hearing it from Skelli because she always said it in such a colorful way.

I hadn't traded places with John since the last Gathering. I had no idea if it would happen again this year.

One good thing that came from meeting John was getting a chance to see them little phone computers they have in Tomorrowmorrowland. I'd already been working on building my own miniature computer so when I was in Tomorrowmorrowland I did some research and got heaps of ideas.

My Firebox wasn't as small as the little phones in Tomorrowmorrowland but it was progress compared to those punch card machines that used to take up a whole room. You could hook it up to a TV set and a walkie talkie and a modified typewriter and bam not only would you have your own computer but you'd be on a motherfucking network that didn't use any wires. Or at least you would be if there was anyone else around to be on a network with. It used a lot of power so it was expensive to run. But hell you could power it with a bicycle if you wanted. Now that I'd seen them phones I knew for sure I was on the right track.

At the Gathering I made a point to park in the same spot as I had the year before. I figured maybe that spot was a portal to another dimension or something. It worked. We traded places again. We figured out that it wasn't that spot that was magic. The magic happened any time we occupied the same space. The Gathering and Wasteland Weekend both happened at the same place in the California desert and we'd both chosen the same parking spot.

Being a pair of clever cunts we immediately started using this newfound superpower to our advantage.
 
This time we spent a few days in switched brains. I could tell John felt bad about what he did to me and Skelli because when I got back to Epoxyclypse John had built some magic software for the Firebox.

John didn't have to think up the ideas himself. He just reimplemented ideas that were successful in his timeline. On day one of the internet we were gonna be bigger than Microsoft and Apple and Facebook combined. Those are the names of some successful companies in Tomorrowmorrowland. Really successful ones. There would be some competition. The whole internet would be free for you to build whatever you wanted on it. But only we had a foolproof way of picking winners. Everyone else would have to use trial and error. We'd be Google and you'd be Ask Jeeves.

John built a social network called You Are Awaited that would let you stay in touch with other people and meet new people too. Maybe someday even people all over the world. That was dependent on everyone having a network connection but if we got enough people with Fireboxes living reasonably close together the wireless network could build itself and repair itself and keep itself alive indefinitely.

But the social network was nothing compared to the other thing that he did. He designed a cryptocurrency and a mining program that would let the Firebox print its own money. It would create Firecoins out of nothing but electricity and math. He made the Firecoin miner an integral part of the computer's software so that everyone who bought a Firebox would have an instant revenue stream from the moment they turned it on. The Firebox would pay for itself! 

The best part was that John gave my Firebox a massive head start on generating Firecoins so that on that day I became the richest person on the fucking planet. I literally had all the money in the world. That is if I could get everyone to accept Firecoins as money. Like I said before though people use money cuz it's convenient. Not cuz a government says it's worth anything. The Firecoin would be convenient as fuck because you could move money around on the network rather than carrying a massive bag of shrapnel around in your pocket. All you had to do was remember some passwords or write them down and hide them.
