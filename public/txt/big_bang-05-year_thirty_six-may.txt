Wasteland Weekend? Spoiled motherfuckers. My life is not your theme park. John's lucky Skelli didn't hit him with a steel pipe.

You fuckers with your anxiety and your depression. The impala overcomes its chronic fatigue syndrome as the cheetah approaches. I'm a goddamn impala every goddamn day. You don't know how good you have it. Airplanes. Skyscrapers. Clean water. Enough food to make everyone fat. Cell phones. The motherfucking internet. You have everything and you think the world owes you more. 

There ain't no such thing as a free lunch. I didn't get a free education. I don't get free health care. We have teachers and doctors but someone has to pay them to teach and doct. Someone has to pay your teachers and doctors too. If someone else is kind enough to pay for your teachers and doctors that's very kind of them. If you force someone else to pay for your teachers and doctors that's not very kind of you. Where I come from we help poor people and sick people and old people but we do it because we want to not because we have to.

Someone said if you don't like people then you're not gonna sell any books. I guess we're gonna have to give these things away.

I was pissed at John for fucking things up with Skelli. It had been a few months since Skelli had last seen "me" but a decade since I'd last seen her. I was worried I'd never see her again. Sure I'd been with other girls but you never forget the first girl who tries to murder you. Any girl can tell you you're a sociopath but I missed hearing it from Skelli because she always said it in such a colorful way.

One good thing that came from trading places with John was getting a chance to see them little pocket computers you all have in Tomorrowmorrowland. When I was there I got heaps of ideas for ways to improve my computer. Mine still wasn't anywhere near as small as the computers in Tomorrowmorrowland but you could carry it around in a backpack. You could hook it up to a TV set and typewriter and a walkie talkie and then not only would you have your own computer but you'd be on a network that didn't use any wires. Now that I'd seen them pocket computers I knew for sure I was on the right track.



Every May there was a race out in Uranium Springs called the Death Rally. Everyone who participates gets a prize except the one who comes in last. Unless you consider being killed and eaten a prize in which case they get a prize too.

I'd never spent any time in Uranium Springs but aside from the Death Rally it's supposed to be a real friendly town. Ever since the Swede had saved me with a radio broadcast that lonely night I'd wanted to visit the place. Maybe I'd get a chance to thank him in person.

The Death Rally itself was on the last day of the event. Yes I know you're hoping I'm gonna be in that race. But no I was not gonna enter. I don't take stupid risks. Sounded like a hell of a show though.

I got there and set up camp. Then I headed for the big radio tower. I introduced myself to the bloke who was running the place. Turned out it was him.

"You're the Swede and you've got what I need! Years ago your voice came out of the darkness and helped me find my way across this godforsaken country. You saved me from some serious shit."

"Glad to hear you say it."

"Someday I'll repay it." 

I shook his hand and thanked him but then he vanished. I was in the same place but it was different. It had happened again. John and I had traded places. 

It was an event similar to Wasteland Weekend called Detonation. Ugh these people again. Maybe John could enter the Death Rally for me and die. Wait I'm not sure who dies in that case so maybe not.

The Gathering and Wasteland Weekend happened at the same place in the California desert. The Death Rally and Detonation happened at the same place in the Arizona desert. When we both attended these similar events in similar places we ended up hopping between timelines.

We figured out that it wasn't Gathering/Wasteland that was magic. The magic happened any time we occupied the same space. Also we don't believe in magic so we think it's probably some kind of science thing.

Anyway now we'd made some sense of it. Being a pair of clever cunts we immediately started using this newfound superpower to our advantage.

This time we spent more time in each others' worlds. I could tell John felt bad about what he did to me and Skelli because when I returned from partying at Detonation I discovered that John had spent his time writing programs for my computer.

John didn't think up these programs himself. He just reimplemented ideas that were successful in his timeline. On day one of the internet we were gonna be bigger than Microsoft and Apple and Facebook combined. Those are some really successful computer companies for those those of you who don't know. 

There would be some competition. The whole network would be free and you could build whatever you wanted on it. But only we had a foolproof way of picking winners. Everyone else would have to use trial and error. We'd be Google and you'd be Ask Jeeves. The first one was successful and the second one wasn't.

John built a social network called You Are Awaited that would let you stay in touch with old friends and make new friends too. But the social network was nothing compared to the other thing he did.

He implemented a cryptocurrency and a mining program that let the computer print its own money. It created money out of nothing but electricity and maths. Everyone who bought one of my computers would have an instant revenue stream. The thing would pay for itself.

The best part was my own personal machine had a massive head start on generating that money. I'd have all the money in the world and you'd be super excited about pedaling your bike for an hour to power your generator long enough for your computer to make you 20 cents. Hell 20 cents is better than no fucking cents so fuck you. Yes I am making the world a better place no matter what you say.

This would only work if I could get everyone to accept this new kind of money. The only way I'd get everyone to accept it would be if everyone had some of it to spend. The only way everyone would have some of my money to spend would be if everyone had one of my computers. So I'd need to make a lot more of them. That would require expensive materials. And that would require funds. 

All I really had to do was make sure I didn't come in last.



.... how many people enter the race? 1? 2? 10? can you run on foot if your car breaks down? or do you have to push it across the line? ....
