The idea of trading places with Firebird on a regular basis was heckin scary. I didn't want to spend that much time in Epoxyclypse. I both loved it and hated it there. Having the ability to hop between timelines was actually very anxiety-inducing, because we couldn't control it as well as we make it sound like we could. We both had to agree to meet at a certain place and a certain time. If we were off a bit in space or time we wouldn't trade places. Other times we'd trade places by accident and find ourselves suddenly thrown into unfamiliar situations. And I don't even like to imagine what would happen if one of us decided to leave the other stranded in the wrong timeline. The whole thing gave me what I now realize are panic attacks. I had them even when I wasn't timeline hopping.

It had been an adventure, for sure. But adventures involve facing things you're not prepared for and taking risks. Isn't it better to adequately prepare for everything and reduce the risks as much as possible?

It's a funny thing to try to measure: risk vs. reward. If you try to measure it, you're likely, in hindsight, to claim you made a mistake when you didn't. For example, imagine preparing to cross a street. You decide to take the risk and step into the road. You get hit by a car. Afterward, you wouldn't say, "Gosh, I guess it just wasn't worth the risk to cross the street that day." That's because the benefits of crossing the street are mundane, obvious, and commonly accepted; and the risks are relatively low. Now imagine risking your life savings to start a business. I'm imagining an automobile restoration shop. If the business failed, I'd never forgive myself. But what if the only reason it failed was lack of luck? I'd have no way of knowing. It takes a certain kind of irrational person to risk everything to open a business, fail, and risk everything again to open another. But those irrational people make the world turn. I thank them for it. But it's not for me.
