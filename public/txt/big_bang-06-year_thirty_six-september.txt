[Firebird]

After the Big Bang the Gathering became known as the place we come to find thems we're looking for and thems we've lost. Didn't matter whether you're looking for love or a friend you haven't met yet or an enemy you haven't battled yet or someone you knew once and lost. Without phones or reliable mail service we needed a designated meeting place. That's the Gathering. 

They'd held a Gathering every year since Year Zero. I hadn't been to all of em of course. But now that I was living in the USA I'd been attending em every year.

Nowadays pretty much everyone in the world knew about the Gathering. Not many could afford to attend but those who could did. There were lots of local gatherings too. But if the person you were looking for might have ended up anywhere in the world then your best hope was to look for them at the biggest gathering in the world. The Gathering in California City USA.

John knew I'd be at this year's Gathering and I knew John would be at this year's Wasteland Weekend. We planned to trade places on purpose for the first time.

Since the Cannibal Run I'd invested all of my money and time into hand-building ten more of my computers to sell at the Gathering. 

I'd decided to call my computer the Firebuddy. It should've been easy to sell a box that makes money and friends. But the Firebuddy would only really be useful to someone if lots of other people had them too. I was going to have to advertise.

I decided to go see the cunt that ran the Gathering's newspaper. I pulled up in front of his tiny office in my rumbling V8. He popped his head out to get a look at my badass car.

I introduced myself. "Firebird."

"Yes it is."

"So am I. Who are you?"

"Deadline."

"How many eyeballs does this paper reach?" I asked.

"Eight thousand" he said absently. Still gawking at my car.

"That's over four thousand people" I replied.

I tried to pitch the idea of him doing an article on the Firebuddy but he wasn't having it. He said he'd be happy to sell me an ad. But I'd gone all in on building ten of these fancy high tech machines so I couldn't afford an ad. I had nothing left to offer.

Except.

I was 100% sure the Firebuddy could change the world. Especially now that John had turbocharged the thing. The question was would other people realize that too? Was I willing to risk everything?

The potential reward was worth the risk. 

No way I was gonna sell my car. But what I would do was bet my car.

I told Deadline he could have my car if he gave me an ad in every paper he published from now until forever. But if he ever wanted to publish a story about the Firebuddy in any of his papers we'd cancel the ad deal and he'd give me the car back.

Today I was small enough to need advertising. Tomorrow I'd be big enough to be news.

We shook on it. I handed him the keys.

I wrote down the ad copy:

MAKE MONEY
FIND LOVE
TRUST THE ALGORITHM
GET YOUR FIREBUDDY TODAY

Deadline got a kick out of it. 

"Say buddy I can tell you're an idea man" he said. "I've got some ideas of my own see? Let me show you something."

He took me through his tiny office and into an even tinier workshop behind it. There was a big mess of wires on the bench connecting a small vertically mounted square to a red light bulb on the table. He flipped a switch and the red light came on. He grabbed a flashlight and told me to close the door.

When I closed the door the red light went off. This was a windowless room. It was dark and I had no idea what was about to happen.

He turned on the flashlight. The red light came on again.

I opened the door. "That's cool man."

That night I slept under the stars on top of a pile of Firebuddies and dreamed of wealth beyond my... wildest dreams. I dunno. I'm not a writer. I'm just a bloke who's trying to tell you a bunch of stuff that happened.



I only sold five. I was fucked.

Or at least I was fucked until I figured out what to do with the other five. It would be a hell of a lot of work though.

I went back and talked to each customer and told them that the almighty Algorithm needed to know who they were friends with so it could use that information to find them new friends. When John and I traded places I asked him to research the lives of our five customers' doppelgangers in his timeline to see if they had friends or spouses or whatever in Tomorrowmorrowland that they hadn't yet met in Epoxyclypse.

At that point for each customer I had a list of friends they had and had not met. Using that information I found someone at the Gathering who they'd never met before but who I was sure they'd like because they were friends in the other timeline. Then I gave each of those people one of the remaining Firebuddies for free. That way when they all signed up for the You Are Awaited social network they'd be sure to have new friends waiting for them there. Even though the network consisted of just ten people. Of course I made it look like there were more than ten people on there by adding lots of fake users.

They all got in touch with each other and they all hit it off. I had five pairs of happy people that were shouting from the rooftops about the miracle that was the Firebuddy. "Trust the Algorithm" they said. I'd accidentally started a cult. 

I frantically took orders and started putting together a gang of clever cunts that could mass produce Firebuddies for me.

At that point if I'd had a door Deadline would have knocked it down to get an interview. He gave me back my car. He'd even washed the thing. The guy was a class act. 

The interview went off the rails when John and I accidentally switched places but that only served to generate more buzz. Everyone wanted to know more about the mad genius named Firebird and his magical Firebuddy.



I stopped in to pick up a copy of Deadline's paper with my interview in it. Deadline was gone. His door was open and his office was trashed.

I was greeted by the Swede instead.

"Hey Swede good to see you again!" I said.

"Hey John what's going on? How'd it go?"

"I'm Firebird. Or at least right now I am. We haven't spoken since the Cannibal Run."

Swede probably thought I was crazy but he didn't let it show. "Firebird again eh? Ok then. Maybe you can help us. Deadline's gone missing." 

He explained that he was Deadline's boss. The newspaper had received a series of threats to Deadline's life. He was last seen at the Civil Defense outpost.

This was not good news. I looked around the office.

There were "clues" all over. The place had more red herrings than a fish market. An unpublished article about the sex practices of a local tribe. Drawings and notes connected nonsensically by strings on a bulletin board. A Twinkie on a chair. 

People don't threaten to do shit. They just do it. People don't get murdered with 4000 people standing around and nobody seeing anything.

I figured he was alive but I had no clue where to look for him. Ok I had clues but they were super shitty ones. None of it made any sense but I promised Swede I'd do what I could.

I asked Civil Defense about Deadline and they said they'd seen him. When he'd left he'd mentioned he was going to do a story on the Cult of Catmeat. The Cult of Catmeat was a bunch of idiots who worshipped a cat. Their leader was known as Grotch.

I found Grotch and a bunch of her followers in an abandoned Christian church which was now looking more like a Satanic one. I sat down in back and watched their antics.

Grotch had on a three foot tall pope hat but it was all black like she was some kind of punk rock popette. The altar of the Cult of Catmeat was covered with stuffed cats. I hoped they were all toys and not real cats but I didn't look too closely. Catmeat himself was there lying in a cardboard box and paying no attention to his adoring minions. The cult members were lined up to receive their communion or baptism or whatever and Grotch was spitting a spray of blood or wine or something into each of their faces.

When the bullshit was over I introduced myself to Grotch and told her I was looking for a cunt named Deadline who owed me money.

"He interviewed several of us at the Gathering. Being a good journalist he participated in our ceremony."

"He let you spit on him."

"Baptize him. Yeah. Then things got weird when an asshole with a mohawk showed up and stabbed him. But Deadline is one of us now. We threw the asshole out and stitched Deadline up."

"Did the asshole with the mohawk say anything?"

"He said he wanted his car back."
