Mohawk A-hole had me in a chokehold. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't move.

I lurched up out of bed with my heart pounding. I thought I was having a heart attack. I couldn't tell which timeline I was in. I was sure Mohawk A-hole was in the room somewhere.

I grabbed my phone. The presence of the phone should have reassured me I was home in Tomorrowmorrowland, but my sleep-addled brain didn't believe it. I took the phone outside, started to dial 911, and held my thumb over the send button.

I sat out there for an hour before I finally felt normal again.

I'd had some fun trading places with Firebird, but I'd had some terrifying moments as well. I didn't want to spend a lot of time in Epoxyclypse. I both loved it and hated it.

I wasn't just having nightmares. I was having panic attacks. The ability to hop between worlds was a source of great anxiety. To ensure we traded places, we had to agree to meet at very specific places and times. If we were off a bit in space or time we wouldn't swap. Other times we'd inadvertently cross paths and find ourselves thrown into unfamiliar situations. I don't even want to imagine what would happen if he decided to leave me stranded in his timeline.

Visiting Epoxyclypse had been an adventure. But adventures involve facing things you're not prepared for and taking risks. Adventure is overrated. I preferred to adequately prepare for things and reduce the risks as much as possible.

It takes a certain kind of irrational person to risk everything. I'm not that kind of person.

Imagine risking all of your savings to start a business, like Firebird did. Most businesses fail. Yet many people are serial entrepreneurs. Those people make the world turn, and I thank them for it. But that was never what I wanted for me. I just wanted to show up at my job every day, get paid, go home, and take lots of vacations. I was well on my way to a comfortable retirement and I didn't want to do anything to mess that up.

In Epoxyclypse the risk of being attacked or killed was much greater. But the risk of our business ventures failing was much lower. I knew exactly what to build. It would just take time. 

I could have stopped visiting Epoxyclypse. But the idea of having a chance to rebuild the world was intoxicating. And I liked the idea of traveling to an alternate reality where I could end up being the richest person on earth. 

It seemed quite possible that Firebird and I were the only people in history that this had ever happened to. How could we let that go to waste?



The Mad Max 40th Anniversary celebration in Australia was coming up. I'd never planned an international journey before. But, thanks to the internet, I was already friends with the event's organizer. This would be my great pilgrimage. My trip to where it all began, and where it all ended.

Several people who were planning to attend started an online discussion about the possibility of making a short film while we were out there. We'd be visiting Mad Max filming locations in Melbourne, Clunes, Silverton, and Broken Hill. We'd have our outfits and tribute cars. All we needed was a script and a director.

My hands were shaking with excitement as I typed. "I'll write and direct it."

Firebird had a pile of stories of all the crazy stuff that had happened to him in Epoxyclypse. I could take one of his stories and turn it into a script.

But my excitement turned to fear when I realized who I should cast. 

I would love to have cast Mad Skelli's counterpart in Tomorrowmorrowland. Believe me, I had tried to find her. But we didn't know her real name. It's probably for the best. It would have been a tough pickup line. "Have we met before, in another timeline?" Or, "Would you sleep with me, if it were the end of the world? I think you already did!"

Not Skelli. 

Mohawk A-hole. Steve Scholz.

I searched for his name. There he was, a tattoo artist living in South Australia.

It wouldn't be too long of a trip for him to come out to Broken Hill. And everyone wants to be a movie star. He probably grew up watching the Mad Max films, as I had. But I could only imagine what it must have been like to have grown up with them as an Australian kid.

It was quite possible that he really was an a-hole. But he wasn't in prison, he hadn't killed my parents, and he hadn't blown up any airports. In Tomorrowmorrowland he seemed like a regular, cool guy.

I went back and forth over it in my head. I was scared, but I didn't want to pass up this bizarre opportunity. I wanted to meet him. But I also knew for a fact that some part of him was quite capable of killing me and my family in cold blood.

Oh, wait. Never mind. I was going to meet him either way. It said right there on his profile that he'd be attending the Mad Max 40th Anniversary.
