Mohawk Asshole was on top of me, stabbing me. Again, and again, and again. I felt the knife going in. It didn't hurt but I knew my body was being destroyed and I could feel that my life was ending.

I lurched up out of bed in the middle of the night with my heart pounding. I thought I was having a heart attack. I couldn't tell which timeline I was in.

I grabbed my phone. The presence of the phone should have reassured me I was home in Tomorrowmorrowland, but my sleep-addled brain didn't believe it. I took the phone outside, started to dial 911, and held my thumb over the send button.

I sat out there for an hour before I finally felt somewhat normal again.

I had to be at work the next day. I'd be falling asleep in my chair again.
 


I'd had some fun trading places with Firebird, but it's important to understand that it also terrified me. I didn't want to spend a lot of time in Epoxyclypse. I both loved it and hated it.

I wasn't just having nightmares. I was having frequent panic attacks. Having the ability to hop between worlds was very anxiety-inducing. To ensure we traded places, we had to agree to meet at very specific places and times. If we were off a bit in space or time we wouldn't swap. Other times we'd inadvertently cross paths and find ourselves thrown into unfamiliar situations. I don't even want to imagine what would happen if he decided to leave me stranded in his timeline.

Visiting Epoxyclypse had been an adventure. But adventures involve facing things you're not prepared for and taking risks. Adventure is overrated. I preferred to adequately prepare for things and reduce the risks as much as possible.

It takes a certain kind of irrational person to risk everything. I'm not that kind of person. Imagine risking all of your savings to start a business, for example. Most businesses fail. Yet many people are serial entrepreneurs. Those people make the world turn, and I thank them for it. But that's not for me. I just wanted to show up at my job every day, get paid, go home, and take lots of vacations. I was well on my way to a comfortable retirement and I didn't want to do anything to mess that up.

In Epoxyclypse the risk of being attacked or killed was much greater. But the risk of our business ventures failing was much lower. I knew exactly what to build. It just took time. 

I could have stopped visiting Epoxyclypse. But the idea of having a chance to rebuild the world was intoxicating. I liked the idea of traveling to an alternate reality where I could end up being the richest person on earth. It seemed quite possible that Firebird and I were the only people in history that this had ever happened to. How could we let that go to waste?

But there's more to the story than that. I was terrified for a reason.
