Firebird moved to Phoenix with me and wanted to trade places on a regular basis. I found this terrifying. I didn't want to spend that much time in Epoxyclypse. I both loved it and hated it there. I do like the idea of traveling to an alternate timeline where I'm the richest person on earth. But having the ability to hop between worlds was also very anxiety-inducing. We had to agree to meet at a certain place and time. If we were off a bit in space or time we wouldn't swap. Other times we'd accidentally cross paths and find ourselves thrown into unfamiliar situations. I don't even want to imagine what would happen if he decided to leave me stranded in his timeline. These kinds of thoughts had been giving me panic attacks since the first time it happened.

It had been an adventure, for sure. But adventures involve facing things you're not prepared for and taking risks. Wouldn't it be better to adequately prepare for everything and reduce the risks as much as possible?

Risk vs. reward is a funny thing to try to measure. If things go wrong, you're likely, in hindsight, to claim you made a mistake in your measurement. Imagine preparing to cross a street. You decide to take the risk and step into the road. You get hit by a car. Afterward, you wouldn't say, "Gosh, I guess it just wasn't worth the risk to cross the street that day." That's because the benefits of crossing the street are mundane, obvious, and commonly accepted. And the risks are relatively low. Now imagine risking your life savings to start a business. I'm imagining an automobile restoration shop. If the business failed, I'd never forgive myself. But what if it really had been a great idea? What if I would have succeeded had it not been for some tiny freak event that unexpectedly changed the market for my services? I'd have no way of knowing.

It takes a certain kind of irrational person to risk everything to open a business, fail, and risk everything again to open another. Those irrational people make the world turn, and I thank them for it. But it's not for me. I just wanted to show up at my job every day, get paid, go home, and take lots of vacations. I was well on my way to a comfortable retirement and I didn't want to do anything to mess that up.

But I did kind of owe the guy. And his girlfriend. And there's the whole richest person on earth thing.
