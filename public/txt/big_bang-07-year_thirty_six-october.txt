I lurched up out of bed in the middle of the night with my heart pounding. I thought I was having a heart attack. I went outside with my phone and started to dial 911. I figured, if I started to pass out, I'd press send.

Eventually moments like this became so frequent that they all blended together into a state of perpetual anxiety. I felt like I was having a heart attack every single minute of every single day. 

Firebird had relocated to Phoenix, or as he called it, Phoenix Crater, so we could trade places on a regular basis.

Yes, I'd had some fun, but it's important to understand that trading places with Firebird terrified me. I didn't want to spend a lot of time in Epoxyclypse. I both loved it and hated it.

I liked the idea of traveling to an alternate reality where I might end up being the richest person on earth. But having the ability to hop between worlds was also very anxiety-inducing. To ensure we traded places, we had to agree to meet at very specific places and times. If we were off a bit in space or time we wouldn't swap. Other times we'd inadvertently cross paths and find ourselves thrown into unfamiliar situations. I don't even want to imagine what would happen if he decided to leave me stranded in his timeline.

Visiting Epoxyclypse had been an adventure. But adventures involve facing things you're not prepared for and taking risks. Adventure is overrated. Wouldn't it be better to adequately prepare for everything and reduce the risks as much as possible? But if you'd been prepared, would you still have referred to it as an adventure?

It takes a certain kind of irrational person to risk everything to open a business, for example. That's not for me. Most businesses fail. Yet there are lots of people who are serial entrepreneurs. Those irrational people make the world turn, and I thank them for it. But that wasn't for me. I just wanted to show up at my job every day, get paid, go home, and take lots of vacations. I was well on my way to a comfortable retirement and I didn't want to do anything to mess that up.

In Epoxyclypse the risk of being randomly attacked or killed was much greater. But the risk of our business ventures failing was much lower. I knew exactly what to build. It just took time. 

I could have stopped visiting Epoxyclypse, but it was just too good. I mean, for many people there, life was terrible. But the idea of going there and having a chance to rebuild the world was intoxicating.

It seemed quite possible that Firebird and I were the only people in history that this had ever happened to. How could we let that go to waste?
