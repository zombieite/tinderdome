After Gathering/Wasteland Firebird relocated to Phoenix, or as they call it in Epoxyclypse, Phoenix Crater. He wanted to trade places on a regular basis. I found this terrifying. 

I didn't want to spend that much time in Epoxyclypse. I both loved it and hated it. I did like the idea of traveling to an alternate reality where I might end up being the richest person on earth. But having the ability to hop between worlds was also very anxiety-inducing. To ensure we traded places, we had to agree to meet at very specific places and times. If we were off a bit in space or time we wouldn't swap. Other times we'd accidentally cross paths and find ourselves thrown into unfamiliar situations. I don't even want to imagine what would happen if he decided to leave me stranded in his timeline. These kinds of thoughts had been giving me panic attacks since the first time it happened.

I'd had my first panic attack many years prior, when I got my friend pregnant. I lurched up out of bed in the middle of the night. I thought I was having a heart attack at age 27. I went outside with my phone and dialed 911. I figured, if I started to pass out, I'd press send.

They became more frequent when my daughter was born. I was in college trying to make a better life for myself, and for her, too, when I was sued for child support.

As I struggled to finish school, the attacks became so frequent that they all blended together to become a state of perpetual anxiety. I felt like I was having a heart attack every single second of every single day. 

I remember the last joyous moment to go was the moment I'd wake up. There was a time when, no matter how bad things got, I could always wake up with a fresh outlook and maybe even manage to forget the bad stuff for a few seconds before it would all come crashing down on my chest again making it impossible to breathe. When I lost even that moment, I would wake up and my heart would already be pounding. Had it been pounding all night long? I'd wonder.

Cortisol, released during times of stress, suppresses the immune system and inhibits learning and memory. Adrenaline constricts blood flow, making heart attacks more likely, and causes heart palpitations, which are very exciting when you're already thinking you're having a heart attack. 

I was always sick. My memory of those times is foggy.

I fixed my life. I'm even what most people would call "successful." But that's a much more fragile state than you'd think. Until you have a pile of cash big enough to retire on, you're chasing the almighty dollar just like everyone else is.

My ability to form new memories never properly returned. Some cognitive decline is normal with aging, but it's proceeded at a much quicker pace for me. I have to obsessively make lists and put everything on my calendar. I'm bad with both names and faces.

Most of my anxiety had subsided over the past few years. I did not enjoy the return of regular panic attacks to my weekly routine.

Visiting Epoxyclypse had been an adventure, for sure. But adventures involve facing things you're not prepared for and taking risks. Wouldn't it be better to adequately prepare for everything and reduce the risks as much as possible?

Risk vs. reward is a funny thing to try to measure. If things go wrong, you're likely, in hindsight, to claim you made a mistake in your measurement. 

Imagine preparing to cross a street. You decide to take the risk and step into the road. You get hit by a car. Afterward, you wouldn't say, "Gosh, I guess it just wasn't worth the risk to cross the street that day." That's because the benefits of crossing the street are mundane, obvious, and commonly accepted. And the risks are relatively low.

Now imagine risking your life savings to start a business. I'm imagining an automobile restoration shop. If the business failed, I'd never forgive myself. But what if it really had been a great idea? What if I would have succeeded had it not been for some tiny freak event that unexpectedly changed the market for my services? I'd have no way of knowing.

It takes a certain kind of irrational person to risk everything to open a business, fail, and risk everything again to open another. Those irrational people make the world turn, and I thank them for it. But it's not for me. I just wanted to show up at my job every day, get paid, go home, and take lots of vacations. I was well on my way to a comfortable retirement and I didn't want to do anything to mess that up.

But I did kind of owe Firebird. And Skelli. And there was the part about becoming the richest person on earth.
