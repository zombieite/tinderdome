"How can I get to Tomorrowland?" the girl asked. She had an Australian accent.

"Buy a ticket like everyone else" I told her. My accent's only half Australian. The other half is Texas.

The old sign was coming down and the new one was going up. The old sign read "The Gathering." The new one read "Tomorrowland Weekend." Carnival barking's not my style so I'd paid some motherfucker to shout for me. "Tomorrowland Weekend! Tomorrowland Weekend! Right this way to Tomorrowland Weekend!" He was a little too good at his job. My ears hurt.

"Not Tomorrowland Weekend" the girl said. "The real Tomorrowland."

"You buy a ticket" I said slowly. I was really trying to emphasize that part. "Then you go in. Maybe while you're in there, you go to Tomorrowland. Maybe not. Maybe you just buy a computer and go home. Now you're holding up the line. You buying a ticket or what?"

"I don't have any money."

"Then get the fuck out of here kid." I called to my bodyguard. "Ulfsbane!"

Ulfsbane growled and the girl jumped back. Then someone even bigger growled and Ulfsbane jumped back. I looked up and fell out of my chair.

An asshole with a mohawk was standing above me. I knew this asshole well. I usually refer to him as Mohawk Asshole. The name is kinda dumb but I gave it to him when I was ten years old so what can I say.

Mohawk Asshole reached down and picked me up. I don't mean he helped me up. I mean my feet were off the ground.

"I brought Bruce with me" the girl said.

I had the FP45 Liberator in my pocket. It was a crap gun and it only held one shot but one shot was all I'd need. The problem was I couldn't get my hand into my pocket cuz of the way he was holding me. I also couldn't breathe all that well.

Fortunately I had an army of loyal customers who came to my defense. A dozen motherfuckers jumped out of line and pulled out guns and knives and one cunt even had a basket-hilted sword. They pointed all that pointy shit at Mohawk Asshole and told him the rule. "No fighting at The Gathering except for in The Cage."

I did the best I could to choke out the words "It's Tomorrowland Weekend" but no one seemed to give a shit.

"Fighting?" Mohawk Asshole asked. He gently put me down. "We're not fighting. I'm just here to see my friend John. Right?"

"Ah yes yes that's right" I said. "Everyone relax. This is my friend Bruce. Ulfsbane take over while we catch up."

I took the girl and Mohawk Asshole back to my trailer and slammed the door.

"Who the fuck are you?" I asked while pointing at the girl. "And what the fuck do you want?" I asked while pointing at Mohawk Asshole.

"I already told you" he said. "I just wanted to pay you a visit. Have some tea. Talk about old times."

"I appreciate the act" I told him. "But you and I both know it's an act."

"All right then" he said. "How about this. I'd like to claw off your skin and pull your ribs out of your chest with my bare hands. Next I'd pull out your liver...."

I interrupted him. "Ok I get it. I already know all that. The feeling is mutual. Why are you here?"

"I want my car back. Give it to me and I won't tell everyone your secret."

I reached into my pocket and pulled out a VIN plate. I tossed it to him. "That's all that's left of the car."

He looked at the VIN plate and started reading aloud. He wasn't reading the letters and numbers though. He remembered what the letters and numbers meant. He was decoding them. He'd loved that car almost as much as I had.

"Pontiac... Trans Am... 2 door coupe... 455 cubic inch 4 barrel V8... 1975...." He paused and looked up before translating the last letter. "Norwood."







My name is Firebird. I invented a computer called the Firebuddy and it made me the world's first post-apocalyptic millionaire. Well strictly speaking I ain't a millionaire anymore cuz I spend all my money on building a bunch of them computers and buying out this whole Gathering event. But Tomorrowland Weekend was gonna help me sell all them computers and in just a few days I was gonna be a two-millionaire.

This book is probably making its way into your hands in Year 39 or so. Not many people have written books in the past 40 years. Every book that does get written kinda has to be a history book and a philosophy book and a survival book too. I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't summarize what I know about how things got to be the way they are.

The reason we call it Year 40 is the Big Bang happened 40 years ago. Year Zero. Also known as 1982. Us prewars remember how it used to be but I'll explain it for you postwars. As you can see from the broken bits and bobs all around you this world used to be a much swankier place. Then the Big Bang came and took everything away. Or I should say it took away everything it could take. It couldn't take away our grit or our guff or our gumption or our good old-fashioned American ingenuity. Yeah people are ingenious all over the world but America was always the best place to be ingenious. The USA was the most prosperous country in history. Sure we did a lot of stuff that was wrong. But you go have a seat in an uncomfortable chair and don't you get up until you figure out what it was we did right.

Ever since I watched my parents get blown to bits in a Sydney airport I've dreamed about another world. A world where the bombs never fell. A couple years ago I discovered that this world was real. And it was possible for me to visit it. It might even be possible for you to visit it too. Come to Tomorrowland Weekend and trade places with another version of yourself!







My name is Firebird because I owned the last Firebird on earth. Now that Firebird is a smashed heap of junk on a street in New Jersey. I kept the steering wheel. I'm gonna send the VIN plate to a guy I refer to as Mohawk Asshole. His real name is Bruce Barbagallo. He's been trying to kill me and steal my car since I was 10 years old. Maybe if I give him the VIN plate he'll leave me alone. Probably not though. He thinks my mom killed his parents so he'll still wanna kill me no matter what I do.




I also wrote another book before this one and made the first movie the world had seen since the Big Bang. I remember the last two movies I saw before the Big Bang. I guess technically it was kind of after the Big Bang cuz my parents had already been killed. The Big Bang wasn't one single day when the whole world blew up. It was more like a few months where everything started to really suck. And everything has sucked ever since. Anyway I wandered into this movie theater that was still trying to maintain a sense of normality. They were showing a double feature. Two true stories about a cop named Max. Back then some cops really were trying to do the right thing even if they did it in the wrong way.
