This book is probably making its way into your hands in the Year 40 or so. Not many books have been written in the past 40 years. So every book that does get written kinda needs to be a history book and a philosophy book and a survival book too. I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't summarize what I remember and what I've pieced together and what I've figured out.

The reason we call it Year 40 is the Big Bang happened 40 years ago. Year Zero. Also known as 1982. As you can see from the broken bits and bobs all around you this world used to be a better place. The Big Bang came and took away everything. Or I should say it took away everything it could take. It couldn't take away grit or guff or gumption or goddamn American ingenuity.

As you may know my name is Firebird and I invented a computer called the Firebuddy. It's better than any of the computers they had back in 1981. It made me the world's first postapocalyptic millionaire. Or at least the first millionaire that didn't get their money by stealing. Don't be jealous of my big fucking heap of coins. Every one of you fuckers gave me your money because you damn well chose to.

Normally when there's a book about a rich guy well the rich guy is gonna be the villain. So you're probably wondering if I'm the villain. I sometimes wonder that too.
