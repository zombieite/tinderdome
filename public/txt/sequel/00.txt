This book is probably making its way into your hands in the Year 40 or so. Not many books have been written in the past 40 years. So every book that does get written kinda has to be a history book and a philosophy book and a survival book too. I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't summarize what I remember and what I've pieced together.

The reason we call it Year 40 is the Big Bang happened 40 years ago. Year Zero. Also known as 1982. Us prewars remember how it used to be but I'll explain it for you postwars. As you can see from the broken bits and bobs all around you this world used to be a much better place. Then the Big Bang came and took everything. Or I should say it took everything it could take. It couldn't take away our grit or guff or gumption or good old-fashioned American ingenuity. Yeah people are ingenious all over the world but you gotta admit that for about a century there America was the best place to be ingenious.

My name is Firebird because I owned the last Firebird on earth. Now that Firebird is a smashed heap of junk on a street in New Jersey. I kept the steering wheel. I'm gonna send the VIN plate to a guy I refer to as Mohawk Asshole. His real name is Bruce Barbagallo. He's been trying to kill me and steal my car since I was 10 years old. Maybe if I give him the VIN plate he'll leave me alone. Probably not though. He thinks my mom killed his parents so he'll still wanna kill me no matter what I do.

A couple years ago I invented a computer called the Firebuddy. It's better than a TRS-80 and it's better than an IBM PC and it's better than any of them other computers they had before the Big Bang. The Firebuddy made me into the world's first post Big Bang millionaire. Or at least the first post Big Bang millionaire that didn't get their money by stealing it. Don't be jealous of my big fucking heap of coins. Every one of you fuckers has a brain in your head. You could have come up with the same damn idea I did. But you didn't. You paid me to come up with the idea so you wouldn't have to.

I also wrote another book before this one and made the first movie the world had seen since the Big Bang. I remember the last two movies I saw before the Big Bang. I guess technically it was kind of after the Big Bang cuz my parents had already been killed. The Big Bang wasn't one single day when the whole world blew up. It was more like a few months where everything started to really suck. And everything has sucked ever since. Anyway I wandered into this movie theater that was still trying to maintain a sense of normality. They were showing a double feature. Two true stories about a cop named Max. Back then some cops really were trying to do the right thing even if they did it in the wrong way.






Ever since I watched my parents get blown to bits in a Sydney airport I've dreamed about another world. A world where the bombs never fell. A couple years ago I discovered that this world was real. And it was possible for me to visit it. It's possible for you to visit it too. Come to Tomorrowland Weekend and trade places with another version of yourself!
