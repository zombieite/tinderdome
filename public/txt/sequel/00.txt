CHAPTER 00
YEAR 38 MONTH 09

The old sign came down and the new one went up. The old sign read "The Gathering." The new sign read "Tomorrowland Weekend."

Carnival barking isn't my style so I'd paid some motherfucker to shout for me. "Tomorrowland Weekend! Tomorrowland Weekend! This is your chance to be part of a better world! Tomorrowland Weekend. Where the Big Bang never happened!" He was a little too good at his job. My ears hurt.

The Gathering used to be this annual free event in the California desert where people came from all over the world to meet up with friends or family or whatever. But this year I'd bought the whole thing out and jazzed it up to look like a non-apocalyptic parallel universe. And I was charging admission.

"Tomorrowland Weekend" the barker yelled. "Where all the shoes have shoelaces. Where all the cars have gasoline. Where all the streets are paved with asphalt."

There was a long line of motherfuckers waiting at the gate. And I was the gatekeeper. Each one of these motherfuckers was here to pay me a hefty sum for a chance to visit another world. And hopefully they'd pay another hefty sum for one of them Firebuddies I had for sale inside. The Firebuddy was the computer I'd invented. It was Firebuddy sales that had paid for this whole damn festival.

Costumes were required. An impeccably-dressed man was at the front of the line.

"What are you dressed up as?" I asked.

"I'm an insurance salesman! Hi. How are ya. Nice weather we're having! Can I interest you in a policy?" He handed me his business card.

"Nailing it! Where'd you get the suit?"

"Found it in a bunker!"

"Far out man." I handed him a ticket. "The briefcase is a nice touch."

Next guy had on a red hat and a yellow coat. He carried an axe. He offered me a fistful of coins for a ticket but I stopped him.

"Nice fireman gettup! That axe is in great shape. Wanna keep your shrapnel and barter me the axe instead?"

He took me up on the deal. He gave me his axe and a business card. I handed him a ticket.

A woman in blue was next.

"What are you?" I asked.

"I'm a police officer!" she said enthusiastically. "Have you done any crimes?"

"Crimes against humanity!" I replied.

"Remain silent!" she chuckled. I handed her a ticket. She started walking away but stopped and turned around. "Almost forgot" she said. She handed me her business card.

I tossed all the cards into an old Pac Man lunchbox. It was overflowing with them.

Lawyer. Race car driver. Teacher. Politician. Astronaut. The prewars were living out their childhood dreams. The postwars were dreaming of a better world they'd only ever heard stories about.

"Are you Firebird?" a teenage girl asked. She had an Australian accent.

"What are you supposed to be? A homeless orphan? You can't wear that here. It breaks immersion."

"You are Firebird."

"Used to be" I said. "Now I got a 77 Ford Pinto Cruising Wagon. Might have to be known as Pinto from now on."

"Will you sign my book?" she asked. She whipped out a copy of a book I'd written a little while back:

AWAITED: NONFICTIONAL DELUSION

I signed the damn book in an attempt get rid of her. It didn't work.

"How can I get to Tomorrowland?" she asked.

"Buy a ticket like everyone else" I told her.

"Not Tomorrowland Weekend" the girl said. "The real Tomorrowland. Like in your book. And in your movie. I've seen your movie like ten times!"

"You buy a ticket." I was really trying to emphasize that part. "Then you go in. While you're in there maybe... MAYBE... you swap timelines with another version of yourself and you teleport into the real Tomorrowland. Maybe not. Maybe you just buy a computer and you go home. Now you're holding up the line. You buying a ticket or what?"

"I don't have any money" she said.

"Ulfsbane!" I called to my bodyguard.

The girl jumped back when Ulfsbane growled at her. But Ulfsbane jumped back when an even bigger fucker growled at him. I looked up and fell out of my chair. An asshole was standing above me. I knew this asshole well.

The girl giggled. "I brought Bruce with me" she said.

Yeah his real name was Bruce but I referred to him as Mohawk Asshole. The name is kinda dumb but I gave it to him when I was ten so what can I say. He got his first name cuz he had a mohawk. He got his last name cuz he killed my family.

And if you're wondering how I got the name Firebird it's cuz I stole this asshole's Firebird that day and proceeded to drive it all over the world for the next few decades. But due to some unpleasantness that car ain't around no more.

Mohawk Asshole reached down and picked me up. I don't mean he helped me up. I mean my feet were off the ground. He had me by the neck.

I had the FP45 Liberator in my pocket. It was a crap gun and it only held one shot but one shot was all I'd need. The problem was I couldn't get my hand into my pocket cuz I was too busy supporting all of my body weight on Mohawk Asshole's arms in order to take some of the pressure off my neck.

"Help... police..." I choked. I could see the police officer talking to the astronaut just a few feet away. She looked at me and smiled and continued talking to her friend.

Fortunately a dozen loyal tomorrowlanders came to my defense. They surrounded him and told him the rule. "No fighting at The Gathering except for in The Cage."

"It's... Tomorrowland... Weekend..." I coughed.

"Fighting?" Mohawk Asshole asked. "We're not fighting. I'm just here to see my friend John."

"It's... Firebird...." Well my name is technically John Binns but if your name were Potty Wastebaskets you'd change it too. When you lose everything in the apocalypse your personal brand is all you got.

The tomorrowlanders pulled out guns and knives and one cunt even had a basket-hilted sword. They pointed all that pointy shit at Mohawk Asshole.

He put me down. I dusted myself off. "It's ok" I said. "This is my friend Bruce. Ulfsbane take over while we catch up."

I took the girl and Mohawk Asshole back to my trailer and sat them both down.

"Who the fuck are you?" I asked while pointing at her.

She opened her mouth but I interrupted.

"And what the fuck do you want?" I asked while pointing at him.

He opened his mouth but I interrupted.

"And why did you bring him here?" I asked while pointing all over the place.

They both started blabbering.

"You first" I said pointing at Mohawk Asshole.

"Thought I'd pay you a visit. Have a cuppa tea."

"I appreciate the buddy-buddy act" I told him. "But we both know it's an act."

"All right then" he said. "Give me my car back and I won't reveal your secret."

I reached into my shirt and took off a necklace I'd made out of the car's VIN plate. I tossed it to him. "That's all that's left of it.'

He looked at the VIN plate and started reading aloud. He wasn't reading the letters and numbers though. He remembered what the letters and numbers meant. He was decoding them. He'd loved that car as much as I had. "Pontiac... Trans Am... 2 door coupe... 455 cubic inch 4 barrel V8... 1975...." He paused and looked up before translating the last letter.

"They ain't never gonna make a car like that again" I said.

"Why not?" the girl asked. "Why not make a new Trans Am?"

I looked at the girl. I looked at Mohawk Asshole.

"Norwood" he said. He got up so fast he knocked over his chair. He ran out the front door of the trailer and started yelling at whoever would listen and also at whoever would not listen.

"There is no Tomorrowland! No one can swap timelines! Firebird's book is a heap of lies!"

He ran off toward the front gate. Still shouting.

"No one can swap timelines?" the girl asked.

"Correct."

The girl looked at me. "So that was... Mohawk Asshole? Not Bruce?"

"Correct."

She stood up. "Tomorrowland doesn't exist?"

"It exists... in our hearts?"

"I came all the way around the world."

"Tomorrowland is the friends you made along the way."

"Fuck you" she said. "I can kill him with or without you." She opened the front door.

"Kill... who?" I asked.

A growing crowd of formerly-loyal tomorrowlanders was mulling about outside my trailer. I would describe their mood as "agitated." I heard someone loudly mention the word "refund."

I looked up at the main gate. The race car driver was yelling at Ulfsbane and the teacher knocked over the cash box. It flew open and coins went everywhere. The lawyer was on the ground grabbing as many of them as he could.

At this point I should probably clarify that the reason the tomorrowlanders all believed they might be able to come to this event and teleport directly into another timeline known as Tomorrowland did indeed have something to do with some of the claims I'd made in that little book I'd written. And the only person on earth in a position to prove or disprove those claims had just run out the door with the goal of informing everyone at the event that I was a charlatan.

I pulled the girl back into the trailer and locked the front door.

"Mohawk Asshole" she said.

People started banging on the door. A molotov cocktail flew through the window and smashed to pieces on top of my Firebuddy inventory. Now they were all in flames.

"Who are you? And where's that damn fireman when you need him."

I looked out the window. Turned out it was the fireman who was lighting up the molotovs.

"I'm Torkdown" she said. "It says here in your book...."

She held up her copy of the book but it was also on fire. She dropped it on the floor and stomped out the flames.

"That book is a heap of lies."

She picked the book up again. "Not all of it. You knew my father. You wrote about him."

"Who's your father?"

"You used to call him Messenger Kid."

Now let me explain who the fuck is Messenger Kid. I refuse to write a flashback because I fucking hate flashbacks. Time moves forward in a linear fashion. And I ain't saying I'm happy about that. Especially when it comes to Messenger Kid. But if that's how time moves then stories should damn well move that way too. Anyway back when the world went to shit I found myself stuck in Australia. Messenger Kid was one of the few friends I had out there. He was the kind of friend who'd risk his ass for you and he just wouldn't think anything of it. The kind of friend where if you were in a burning house and someone started talking about him in the past tense you'd stop and ask what the fuck are you talking about.

"What the fuck are you talking about?" I asked.

"My father is dead" she said.

"Ok. Come with me Dorktown."

"It's Torkd--...." I grabbed the girl in one hand and my axe in the other and we went out the back door. We hopped into my Pinto and I tried to get it started.

I say tried cuz this car was no Firebird. It had one third the torque. One third the horsepower. And it took three times as long to get it started.

The angry tomorrowlanders heard us and came running around back. We locked our doors.

The insurance salesman climbed onto the hood and banged his briefcase on the windscreen. The astronaut used their helmet to headbutt the side glass. The fireman lobbed another molotov at us.

The engine finally started turning over on its own power. I floored it and managed to shake off the insurance guy. His briefcase flew open and papers went everywhere.

I looked in the rear view mirror. The entire compound was burning.

"Guess I should have bought that insurance policy" I muttered.



We retreated to the Woolworth's diner in Bakersfield to hide out.

"Oh my god is that her?" Dorktown jumped out of our booth and ran to the door.

"Shut up Dorktown!" I said. "You're gonna get us killed." I tried to hide my face.

"Mad Skelli! Will you sign my book?"

"Sure kid" Skelli said. "Mind if I sit down first?"

Skelli joined me and Dorktown at the booth. We ordered burgers and malts.

"Make it out to Torkdown" she said.

"Isn't she a bit young for you?" Skelli asked.

"Yeah right. She's not my girlfriend. She's my... uh...."

"I'm his adventure partner" Dorktown volunteered. "We want you to be our adventure partner too."

"No she's not and no we don't. Just ignore her" I said. "She had too much sugar this morning. So did you make it out of there with your net worth intact?"

"Yeah" Skelli nodded. "My DingoDongles were in the back of the Sandman." The Sandman was the groovy set of wheels she'd brought over here from Australia. The DingoDongle was the computer she'd invented after stealing the idea from me. I had no hard feelings about that. The DingoDongle snapped onto your forearm and had heaps of cool games. It was a nice piece of work. Anyway she continued. "When the place went up in flames I jumped into the Sandman and kicked it in the guts. How'd you make out?"

"Not too good. That's why we're here. I need to borrow some money."

"You're the world's first postapocalyptic millionaire! What the fuck do you need to borrow money from me for?"

"You're the world's second postapocalyptic millionaire. Who else am I gonna borrow it from?"

She rolled her eyes. "I mean why do you need the money?"

"I spent everything I had turning The Gathering into Tomorrowland Weekend. Now Tomorrowland Weekend is gone. The ticket money is gone. The Firebuddies are gone." I always had a Firebuddy in my backpack but aside from that I had nothing left to sell or barter. I had a Firebuddy factory out in Arizona but for all I knew the angry tomorrowlanders were on their way there now to burn that down too.

"Not my problem." Skelli stood up.

Dorktown jumped up and sat Skelli back down. "Ignore him" Dorktown said. "He hasn't had enough sugar this morning. Here's the deal. We're gonna kill Mohawk Asshole. We're gonna reopen the Trans Am factory and build more Trans Ams. We're gonna become best friends along the way. You're coming with us because after you pay for this trip and pay to recommission the factory Firebird will give you 50% of the Trans Am money."

"Ten" I said.

"Sixty" Skelli said.

"Deal" Dorktown said. "But the real reason you're coming with us is Mohawk Asshole killed Messenger Kid."

Skelli's face fell.

"And the reason I'm coming along is Messenger Kid was my father."

Skelli put her hand on the girl's shoulder. "I'm in" she said.

"All right Dorktown" I said. "If you're coming along you gotta know what you're getting yourself into. James Bond had a saying. Before setting out on revenge you first dig two graves."

"Who's James Bond? I'll dig as many graves as you want. Let's get the fuck out of here."

Dorktown went up to the counter and spoke to the owner of the diner. He turned around and reached up to the wall behind him and took down a gorgeous vintage crossbow. He handed it to her. She looked at it for a moment and said a few words and smiled. He reached under the counter and handed her a single arrow. She bent over the counter and gave him a kiss on the cheek. She left with the crossbow.

"I thought you didn't have any money!" I said.

"I don't."

I laughed. "You might just prove to be an asset after all."

We all piled into the Pinto.

"Where are we headed?" Skelli asked.

"Norwood!" Dorktown said.

I corrected her. "Van Nuys."
