The old sign came down and the new one went up. The old sign read "The Gathering." The new sign read "Tomorrowland Weekend."

Carnival barking isn't my style so I'd paid some motherfucker to shout for me. "Tomorrowland Weekend! Tomorrowland Weekend! Become another version of yourself. See a better world! Right this way to Tomorrowland Weekend!" He was a little too good at his job. My ears hurt.

There was a long line of motherfuckers waiting at the gate. And I was the gatekeeper. Each one of these motherfuckers was here to pay me a hefty sum for a chance to visit a world where the bombs never fell. And hopefully another hefty sum for one of the fancy new computers I had for sale inside.

A well-dressed man with a briefcase handed me a fistfull of coins.

"What are you?" I asked.

"I'm a businessman! Hi. How are ya. Nice weather we're having! How’s the wife and kids? I got a new sports car and watch!" He handed me his business card.

"Nailing it! Where'd you get the suit?"

"Found it in a bunker!"

"Far out man." I handed him a ticket. "Briefcase is a nice touch."

A woman dressed in blue handed me a fistful of coins.

"What are you dressed up as?" I asked.

"I'm a police officer!" she said enthusiastically. She handed me her business card.

"Oh no! Don't arrest me! Crimes against humanity!"

"Remain silent!" she chuckled.

I handed her a ticket.

Next guy had on a red hat and a yellow coat. He carried an axe. He offered me a fistfull of coins.

"Nice fireman gettup! That axe is in great shape. Wanna keep your cash and gimme the axe instead?"

He took me up on the deal. I took his axe and gave him a ticket. He started walking away but then quickly turned back.

"Almost forgot" he said. He handed me his business card.

Lawyer. Race car driver. Teacher. Politician. Astronaut. The prewars were finally living out their childhood dreams. The postwars were dreaming of a better world they'd only ever heard stories about. Sure Tomorrowland Weekend was fake. It was roleplay. But I was gonna rebuild the world. I was gonna give them back the real thing. The real Tomorrowland. The computers I was selling were only the beginning. I knew that one day those computers would fit in your pocket. We'd have skyscrapers with working elevators. Jets and satellites and missions to the moon. Muscle cars roaming the streets. It was only a matter of time. And the ingenuity of clever cunts like me. Inventing shit. Improving shit. Making money by earning it instead of stealing it.

I tossed the business cards into an old Pac Man lunchbox. It was overflowing with them.

"Are you Firebird?" a girl asked. She had an Australian accent.

"Used to be" I said. "Might have to go by Pinto from now on. What are you supposed to be? A homeless person? You can't wear that here. It breaks immersion."

"Will you sign my book?" she asked. She whipped out a copy of a little book I'd written a couple years earlier:

AWAITED: NONFICTIONAL DELUSION

I signed the damn thing in an attempt get rid of her. It didn't work.

"How can I get to Tomorrowland?" she asked.

"Buy a ticket like everyone else" I told her.

"Not Tomorrowland Weekend" the girl said. "The real Tomorrowland."

"You buy a ticket." I was really trying to emphasize that part. "Then you go in. While you're in there maybe... MAYBE... you swap timelines with another version of yourself and you teleport into the real Tomorrowland. Maybe not. Maybe you just buy a computer and go home. Now you're holding up the line. You buying a ticket or what?"

"I don't have any money" she said.

"Ulfsbane!" I called to my bodyguard.

The girl jumped back when Ulfsbane growled at her. But Ulfsbane jumped back when an even bigger fucker growled at him. I looked up and fell out of my chair. An asshole was standing above me. I knew this asshole well.

The girl giggled. "I brought Bruce with me" she said.

Yeah his real name was Bruce but I referred to him as Mohawk Asshole. The name is kinda dumb but I gave it to him when I was ten so what can I say. He got his first name cuz he had a mohawk. He got his last name cuz he killed my family.

And if you're wondering how I got the name Firebird it's cuz I stole this asshole's Firebird that day and proceeded to drive it all over the world for the next few decades. But due to some unpleasantness that car ain't around no more.

Mohawk Asshole reached down and picked me up. I don't mean he helped me up. I mean my feet were off the ground. He had me by the neck.

I had the FP45 Liberator in my pocket. It was a crap gun and it only held one shot but one shot was all I'd need. The problem was I couldn't get my hand into my pocket cuz I was too busy supporting all of my body weight on Mohawk Asshole's arms in order to take some of the pressure off my neck.

A dozen loyal customers came to my defense. They pulled out guns and knives and one cunt even had a basket-hilted sword. They pointed all that pointy shit at Mohawk Asshole and told him the rule. "No fighting at The Gathering except for in The Cage."

"It's Tomorrowland Weekend" I choked. No one seemed to give a shit.

"Fighting?" Mohawk Asshole asked. "We're not fighting. I'm just here to see my friend John."

"It's Firebird" I said. I was still dangling in the air and still choking out my words. And still no one gave a shit. My name is technically John Binns but if your name were Potty Wastebaskets you'd change it too. When you lose everything in the apocalypse your personal brand is all you got.

Mohawk Asshole dropped me. I dusted myself off. "It's ok" I said. "This is my friend Bruce. Ulfsbane take over while we catch up."

I took the girl and Mohawk Asshole back to my trailer and sat them both down.

"Who the fuck are you?" I asked while pointing at her. "And what the fuck do you want?" I asked while pointing at him. "And why did you bring him here?" I asked while first pointing at her and then pointing at him.

They both started blabbering at the same time.

"You first" I said pointing at Mohawk Asshole.

"Thought I'd pay you a visit. Have a cuppa tea."

"I appreciate the buddy-buddy act" I told him. "But we both know it's an act."

"All right then" he said. "Give me my car back and I won't tell everyone your secret."

I reached into my shirt and took off a necklace I'd made out of the car's VIN plate. I tossed it to him. "That's all that's left of it. They ain't never gonna make a car like that again."

He looked at the VIN plate and started reading aloud. He wasn't reading the letters and numbers though. He remembered what the letters and numbers meant. He was decoding them. He'd loved that car as much as I had. "Pontiac... Trans Am... 2 door coupe... 455 cubic inch 4 barrel V8... 1975...." He paused and looked up before translating the last letter.

"Why not?" the girl asked. "Why not make a new Trans Am?"

I looked at the girl. I looked at Mohawk Asshole.

"Norwood" he said. He got up so fast he knocked over his chair. He ran out the front door of the trailer and started yelling.

"There is no Tomorrowland!" he shouted. "No one can swap timelines! Firebird's book is a heap of lies!"

Mohawk Asshole ran off toward the front gate. He kept shouting to anyone who would listen.

"No one can swap timelines?" the girl asked.

"Correct."

The girl looked at me. "So that's... Mohawk Asshole? Not Bruce?"

"Correct."

She stood up. "Tomorrowland doesn't exist?"

"It exists... in our hearts?"

"I came all the way around the world."

"Tomorrowland is the friends you made along the way."

"Fuck you" she said. "I can kill him with or without you." She opened the front door.

A growing crowd of no-longer-loyal customers was mulling about outside my trailer. I would describe their mood as "agitated." I heard someone loudly mention the word "refund." At this point I should clarify that the reason they all believed they might be able to teleport to Tomorrowland did indeed have something to do with some of the claims I'd made in that book. I'd claimed that both me and Mohawk Asshole had swapped timelines with other versions of ourselves. I'd claimed that we'd seen a better world. A world where the bombs never dropped. Everyone at Tomorrowland Weekend was as desperate to see that world as I was. They were not happy to find out it was never gonna happen.

I pulled the girl back into the trailer and locked the front door.

"What did you say?" I asked.

People started banging on the door.

"I'm going to kill him" she said.

A brick flew through the window.

"What's your name?"

Smoke. Flames. The trailer was now definitely on fire. Where was that fireman when you needed him? I looked out the window and saw him holding a torch and laughing maniacally.

"Torkdown. You knew my father. You wrote about him... in your book!"

She whipped out her copy of the book again. It was on fire. She dropped it on the floor. I grabbed my axe and used it to pat out the flames.

"You heard him. That book is a heap of lies."

"Not all of it."

"Who's your father?"

"You used to call him Messenger Kid."








The angry peasants burn down all of Tomorrowland Weekend and all of FB's computer inventory. Maybe Skelli's too.

FB to Skelli: "I need to borrow some money."

"You're the world's first postapocalyptic millionaire. Why do you need to borrow money from me?"

"You're the world's second postapocalyptic millionaire. Who else am I going to borrow money from?"

He probably gets her to agree to come along once DT tells her about MK.

So yeah my name's Firebird. They call me that cuz I owned the last Firebird on earth. That Firebird is now a smashed heap of junk on a street in New Jersey thanks to yet another person who was trying to kill me.

I invented a computer called the Firebuddy and it made me the world's first post-apocalyptic millionaire. Well I was a millionaire until I spent all my money buying out this whole Gathering thing and turning it into Tomorrowland Weekend. But if everything goes according to plan I'll sell enough computers during Tomorrowland Weekend to be a two-millionaire by next week.

I'm writing this book in Year 39. The reason we call it Year 39 is cuz the Big Bang happened 39 years ago. That was Year Zero. Not many people have written books in the past 39 years. Every book that does get written kinda has to be a history book and a philosophy book and a survival book too. So I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't summarize what I know about how things got to be the way they are.

Us prewars remember how it used to be but I'll explain it for you postwars. As you can see from the broken bits and bobs scattered all around you this world used to be a much swankier place. Then the Big Bang came and took everything away. Or I should say it took away everything it could take. It couldn't take away grit or guff or gumption or good old-fashioned American ingenuity. Yeah people are ingenious all over the world but back then America was the best place to be ingenious. The USA was the most prosperous country in history. It's easy to figure out all the things that the USA did wrong. But it's not so easy to figure out what exactly it was that the USA did right. Seems kinda important though.

I'm gonna rebuild the world and I'm gonna do it right. Ever since I watched my parents get blown to bits in a Sydney airport I've dreamed about another world. A world where the bombs never fell.
å
A couple years ago I discovered that this world was real. And it was possible for me to visit it. It might even be possible for you to visit it too. Come to Tomorrowland Weekend and trade places with another version of yourself!

I also wrote another book before this one and made the first movie the world had seen since the Big Bang. I remember the last two movies I saw before the Big Bang. I guess technically it was kind of after the Big Bang cuz my parents had already been killed. The Big Bang wasn't one single day when the whole world blew up. It was more like a few months where everything started to really suck. And everything has sucked ever since. Anyway I wandered into this movie theater that was still trying to maintain a sense of normality. They were showing a double feature. Two true stories about a cop named Max. Back then some cops really were trying to do the right thing even if they did it in the wrong way.
