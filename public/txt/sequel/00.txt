Girl comes to tomorrowland weekend. Says she NEEDS to switch timelines. firebird tells her that's what everyone else is here for too. buy a ticket like everyone else. she has no money for a ticket. maybe she points a gun at him or something. it comes out she needs to kill MA because he killed her father. firebird somehow hems and haws and pretends to help her but it comes out that he never swapped timelines, the ending of the last book was partly made up, and MA is still in damnation valley. i wanted MA to reveal the timeline-swap-not-real-thing though so maybe they should think they're finding bruce the tattoo artist and asking him to help swap places with MA.... maybe they know where MA is, or firebird says he does, or something.....

girl asks how FB survived, he tells her the fake story of grabbing the grieving woman's gun and killing her with it.

MA appears and FB falls out of his chair. MA can't be violent because they're at the gathering AKA TW. girl thinks he's not violent cuz he's just bruce. she introduces herself to MA and says she knows he's just bruce the tattoo artist. MA reveals no, he's really MA, why would he not be? MA hasn't read the book. maybe Girl gives him a copy and he reads it and laughs. he reveals timeline swapping doesn't happen and leaves. Girl asks FB why he didn't kill MA in the cage. FB says "cracking skulls ain't all it's cracked up to be."




"Tomorrowland Weekend! Tomorrowland Weekend! Right this way to Tomorrowland Weekend!" the motherfucker shouted. I paid him to shout. Carnival barking's not my style.

The old sign came down as the new one went up. The old sign read "The Gathering." Now it was Tomorrowland Weekend. I'd bought out the whole event. I gave it a snappier name. Do you like it? I'm having second thoughts. No one even knows what a weekend is anymore. It don't matter what day it is. Every day everyone just does what they gotta do. No more no less.

My name is Firebird. I'm the world's first post-apocalyptic millionaire. Or at least I was until I wasted my fortune on this this damn Tomorrowland Weekend idea.

A couple years ago I invented a computer called the Firebuddy. It made me a million bucks. It's way better than an IBM PC and any of them other computers they used to have before the Big Bang. Don't be jealous of my big heap of coins. Every one of you fuckers has a brain in your head. You could have come up with the damn idea. But you didn't. You paid me to come up with the idea so you wouldn't have to.

This book is probably making its way into your hands in the Year 40 or so. Not many people have written books in the past 40 years. So every book that does get written kinda has to be a history book and a philosophy book and a survival book too. I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't summarize what I remember and what I've pieced together.

The reason we call it Year 40 is the Big Bang happened 40 years ago. Year Zero. Also known as 1982. Us prewars remember how it used to be but I'll explain it for you postwars. As you can see from the broken bits and bobs all around you this world used to be a much swankier place. Then the Big Bang came and took everything away. Or I should say it took away everything it could take. It couldn't take away our grit or our guff or our gumption or our good old-fashioned American ingenuity. Yeah people are ingenious all over the world but America was always the best place to be ingenious. The USA was the most prosperous country in history. Sure we did a lot of stuff that was wrong. But you go have a seat in an uncomfortable chair and don't you get up until you figure out what it was we did right.

Ever since I watched my parents get blown to bits in a Sydney airport I've dreamed about another world. A world where the bombs never fell. A couple years ago I discovered that this world was real. And it was possible for me to visit it. It might even be possible for you to visit it too. Come to Tomorrowland Weekend and trade places with another version of yourself!







My name is Firebird because I owned the last Firebird on earth. Now that Firebird is a smashed heap of junk on a street in New Jersey. I kept the steering wheel. I'm gonna send the VIN plate to a guy I refer to as Mohawk Asshole. His real name is Bruce Barbagallo. He's been trying to kill me and steal my car since I was 10 years old. Maybe if I give him the VIN plate he'll leave me alone. Probably not though. He thinks my mom killed his parents so he'll still wanna kill me no matter what I do.




I also wrote another book before this one and made the first movie the world had seen since the Big Bang. I remember the last two movies I saw before the Big Bang. I guess technically it was kind of after the Big Bang cuz my parents had already been killed. The Big Bang wasn't one single day when the whole world blew up. It was more like a few months where everything started to really suck. And everything has sucked ever since. Anyway I wandered into this movie theater that was still trying to maintain a sense of normality. They were showing a double feature. Two true stories about a cop named Max. Back then some cops really were trying to do the right thing even if they did it in the wrong way.
