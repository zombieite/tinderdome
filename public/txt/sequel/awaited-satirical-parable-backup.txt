CHAPTER 00: tomorrowland

The old sign came down as the new one went up. The old sign read "The Gathering." The new sign read "Tomorrowland Weekend."
"Tomorrowland Weekend! Where the Big Bang never happened!" Carnival barking isn't my style so I paid some motherfucker to shout for me. I called him Johnny Olson after that bloke who used to shout "A new car!" on The Price Is Right. "You are awaited at Tomorrowland Weekend!"
The Gathering used to be this free event in the California desert where lost souls came from all over the world to meet up with family and friends or whatever. But this year I'd bought out the whole damn thing and jazzed it up to look like a nonapocalyptic parallel universe I called Tomorrowland.
"Tomorrowland Weekend!" Johnny Olson barked. "Where there is no suffering! No hunger! No war! No politics! Nothing to fight over. All the shoes have shoelaces. All the cars have guzzoline. The streets are paved with asphalt!"
Hundreds of motherfuckers were lined up at the gate and I was the gatekeeper. To get into Tomorrowland Weekend you had to.... well I'll let Johnny explain it.
"Costumes and Firebuddy required for entry!" he screamed. "If you do not have a Firebuddy you can buy one at the door."
The Firebuddy was a "laptop" computer I'd invented. I called it a laptop cuz it was small enough to fit on your lap. It was Firebuddy sales that had paid for this whole damn festival. Costumes were required so that when you came to Tomorrowland Weekend you'd feel like you'd really entered a parallel universe where the bombs had never fallen. People built fake little office buildings or flower shops or libraries or whatever and pretended that life was beautiful and boring.
At the front of the line stood an impeccably-dressed man. Suit and tie and hat and everything. It was Year 38 now so I was damn sure it had been 38 years since I'd seen a bloke dressed up that nice. I remembered being a kid seeing my dad off to work and he'd be dressed like that.
"What are you supposed to be?" I asked.
"I'm an insurance salesman! Hi. How are ya. How are the wife and kids? Can I interest you in a policy of insurance?" He handed me his business card.
"Nailing it. Where'd you get the suit?"
"Found it in a bunker."
"Far out." I said. He showed me his Firebuddy and I waved him in. "The briefcase is a nice touch."
Next guy had on a red hat and a yellow coat. He carried an axe. He offered me a metal bucket full of coins but I stopped him.
"Nice fireman gettup. That axe is in great shape mate."
"The head's a little loose."
He handed it to me so I could take a closer look. "Looks all right." I said. "Wanna keep your shrapnel and barter me this instead?"
He took me up on the deal. He gave me the axe and his business card. I handed him a Firebuddy.
A woman in a homemade blue uniform was next.
"What are you?" I asked.
"I'm a police officer!" she said enthusiastically. "Have you done any crimes?"
"Crimes against humanity!" I replied.
"Remain silent!" she chuckled.
She handed me a framed twenty dollar bill pressed between two sheets of plexiglass. Ugh.
"You don't have coins?" I asked.
"This is all I've got."
"You're gonna have to take it out of there. And you're not getting change." Nowadays most people were using Firebucks which was a computerized currency I'd come up with. But to use Firebucks you had to have a Firebuddy or some other kind of computer like a DingoDongle or an Assholebuddy. Nice part was over time the computer could generate new Firebucks using nothing but electricity and maths. In a year or two your computer would pay for itself. Now you get why so many people were standing in line.
The police officer put the frame on the ground and borrowed my axe to break it open. She handed the axe back to me. "Head's a little loose" she said.
She carefully pulled the sheets of plastic apart and handed me the bill. I handed her a Firebuddy.
She started walking away but stopped and turned back. "Almost forgot" she said. "Here's my business card."
I had a little table set up with two of my childhood lunchboxes on it. The business cards went into my Pac Man lunchbox. The money went into my Six Million Dollar Man lunchbox. Both of them were overflowing.
One bloke was dressed as a construction worker. Another was a race car driver. There was a movie star. A doctor. There was even someone dressed up as a thief but he just reminded me of the Hamburglar. The prewars were living out their stolen childhood dreams. The postwars were dreaming of a world they'd never known.
"Are you Firebird?" a teenage girl asked. She had an Australian accent.
"Used to be" I said. "That car was smashed to bits. Now I drive a 77 Ford Pinto. Might have to be known as Pinto from now on. What are you supposed to be? A homeless orphan? You can't wear that here. It breaks immersion."
"Will you sign my book?" she asked. She handed me a copy of a book I'd written a little over a year ago:

AWAITED: NONFICTIONAL DELUSION

"Make it out to Torkdown."
"Dorktown?"
"Torkdown."
"To... Dorktown...." I scribbled my name.
"How can I get to Tomorrowland?" she asked.
"Buy a Firebuddy like everyone else" I told her.
"Not Tomorrowland Weekend" the girl said. "The real Tomorrowland. Like in your book."
A lot of people had read that book and taken it a bit too seriously. A lot of people had gotten it into their heads that Tomorrowland was a real place you could visit. That's what gave me the idea for Tomorrowland Weekend. Tomorrowland Weekend wouldn't just be a party in the desert. It would be a chance to live in the world of my book. It would be a lifestyle. An identity. A culture. A family. We were no longer merely attendees of the Gathering or Tomorrowland Weekend. We were tomorrowlanders. We were gonna rebuild the world and this time we were gonna do it right. But it was gonna take work. Some of these lazy fucks thought they could jump out of this world and into a better one just by changing their clothes. And this girl hadn't even bothered to do that.
"You gotta buy a Firebuddy." I told her. I was really trying to emphasize that part. "You gotta dress up. Then I let you in. While you're in there maybe... maybe you swap timelines with another version of yourself and you teleport into the real Tomorrowland. Maybe not. Maybe you just buy a computer and go home. Now you're holding up the line. You buying a Firebuddy or what?"
"I don't have any money" she said.
"Ulfsbane!" I shouted.
My hired hunk appeared and grabbed the problem child.
"Take her to the highway and let her hitchhike back to Australia."
At that moment a skirmish broke out in line and Ulfsbane let the girl run off. Me and Ulfsbane and a heap of other motherfuckers surrounded the assholes who were fighting.
The race car driver and the movie star had knives in their hands and they had the construction worker on the ground. He was unarmed. They'd already cut him up good and they were about to finish the job.
"Show us what he looks like on the inside!" somebody shouted.
But then some other bloke shouted "No fighting at The Gathering except for in The Cage!"
The fighting paused and all eyes turned to me. I hated making decisions like this but I put on my best authoritative badass face.
"There ain't no laws anymore but that don't mean there ain't no rules" I said. "It's not The Gathering anymore. It's Tomorrowland Weekend. But the rule still holds."
"You don't get it" the race car driver explained. "He's a Helly."
Someone shouted "Kill all Hellies."
I turned to Ulfsbane. "What's a Helly?"
Talking to Ulfsbane was pretty much like talking to a hole in the ground. He grunted.
The movie star added "And we're not inside The Gathering yet." She pointed to some orange tape I'd nailed to the ground beneath the sign.
I had to think fast if I didn't want a dead body stinking up the line. I went over to the tape on the ground and pulled it up and away from the entrance gate. I unspooled some more and walked it around the fighting fuckers and back to the gate. I put a couple new nails into the ground to hold the tape in its new position.
"Welcome to Tomorrowland Weekend" I said to the three of them.
"See you in The Cage Helly" the race car driver said to the construction worker.
The movie star showed me her Firebuddy and threw a card on my table.
The race car driver handed me his money and grabbed a Firebuddy from the stack. He gave me a card that read "Dr. Freaky Freedoms PhD. President Of The Gillies. Kill All Hellies."
"What's a Gilly?" I asked Ulfsbane.
Ulfsbane grunted.
The construction worker got up and showed me his Firebuddy. "You did the right thing" he said. "We're on the winning side of history."
"I'm not on any side of history" I replied.
He handed me his card. It had blood on it. It read "Count Bartholomu Booberry. President Of The Hellies. Death to Gillies."
He went in. The doctor was next in line.
"That man needs medical attention" I said.
Her eyes narrowed over her surgical mask. "When you saved that man's life you sent a message loud and clear that you want to erase the existence of people like me."
"What kind of a person are you?" I asked.
"It's time you asked yourself that question" she hissed.

"Welcome to the first ever Tomorrowland Weekend!" I shouted into the megaphone from the center of The Cage.
Night had fallen. The race car driver was on one side of The Cage and the construction worker was on the other. I handed swords to both of them.
Hundreds of people stood outside The Cage screaming and cheering and banging on the fence. I gestured for them to quiet down.
"People have come from all over the world to be here tonight. Some of us are here to find thems we're looking for and thems we've lost. Some of us are here to make money. Some of us are here to have a good time. But all of us are here because we want to build a better tomorrow!" I paused for a big cheer but it wasn't as big as I'd hoped.
"Death to Gillies!" someone shouted.
"Kill all Hellies!" someone retorted.
"Death comes soon enough!" I said. "It doesn't matter if you're a Helly or a Gilly. We are all tomorrowlanders!" Again the crowd was not enthused. It was time to give them what they wanted.
"When the world goes crazy you gotta get crazy too. Dollars to donuts every one of us here tonight has killed at some point in their lives. Ever since the first great Gathering 38 years ago there have been Cage matches to resolve conflicts like this. Tonight Tomorrowland Weekend continues this storied tradition!"
Now the crowd was getting worked up. A little too much maybe. The whole Cage was shaking.
"Death to Gillies!" half of them shouted.
"Kill all Hellies!" half of them replied.
"And tonight's Cage match is not just any Cage match. It's the most significant Cage match of the modern era! In this corner we have Count Bartholomu Booberry. President Of The Hellies!"
Half the crowd cheered.
"And in this corner we have Dr. Freaky Freedoms PhD. President Of The Gillies!"
The other half cheered.
"Let the battle begin!"
The crowd went mad and I got the hell out of there. I handed the megaphone to Johnny on the way out.
"You're not gonna stay and watch? This one's gonna be good" he said.
"I got work to do."
I went back to my trailer and fired up my Firebuddy. The Firebuddy would automatically connect to other nearby computers and let you communicate with them. When you bought a Firebuddy it came with free access to a "social networking website" I'd built called You Are Awaited.
The messages people posted on You Are Awaited used to be hopeful and friendly and positive. But lately things were different. People had started posting things like "If you're a Gilly we can't be friends" and "Hellies should be lined up and shot." I scrolled through the messages. There was no end to the vitriol.
My algorithm had noticed that people wanted to talk about this stuff so it had encouraged them. What had I done?CHAPTER 01: dorktown

There was a knock at the door. I opened it. It was Dorktown.
"You again? Ulfsbane!" I shouted.
"No wait" she said. "I have a Firebuddy now. Ulfsbane let me in." She showed me her new laptop.
"I thought you didn't have any money."
"I don't."
"How'd you get a Firebuddy?"
"Somebody gave me one."
"You still look like a ragamuffin."
"What are you supposed to be? What's with the cowboy hat and leather jacket?"
"I'm a software engineer named John Binns who's attending a postapocalyptic festival called Wasteland Weekend."
She giggled.
"Why are you here?" I asked.
"I need to talk to you about Tomorrowland. But first I have a surprise."
"I hate surprises. Just tell me what it is."
"A friend of yours is here to see you."
"I don't have any friends."
"Yes you do. You wrote about him in your book. Ulfsbane won't let him in even though he has a Firebuddy."
I thought about everyone I'd written about in my book. Dorktown was from Australia. I was only friends with one bloke out there. Could it be... Messenger Kid?
"All right let's go."
When we stepped outside I looked over at The Cage. Some people had climbed up the sides and onto the top. The entire structure was rocking back and forth. The crowd hooted and hollered like a pack of hungry animals. Maybe tonight this Hellies and Gillies stuff would be decided once and for all and I'd never have to hear about it again.
We headed away from The Cage toward the Tomorrowland Weekend entrance gate. The light was broken and Ulfsbane was messing with the bulb. All I could see was the silhouette of a man who was definitely not Messenger Kid.
We were just a few feet away when the light suddenly flickered on and lit up his face.
"G'day mate!" said a maniacal grinning mohawked head wearing a goddamn tuxedo.
I leaped back in terror and fell to the ground. "Jesus fucking christ" I said. Did I mention he was wearing a tuxedo?
Dorktown giggled. "I found Bruce!" she said.
Yeah his real name was Bruce but I referred to him as Mohawk Asshole. The name is kinda dumb but I gave it to him when I was ten so what can I say. He got his first name cuz he had a mohawk. He got his last name cuz he killed my family.
And if you're wondering how I got the name Firebird it's cuz I stole Mohawk Asshole's Firebird Trans Am on the day he killed my family and drove it around for a few decades.
I got up and pulled out my FP45 Liberator. I twisted the cocking knob into place and stuck it in Mohawk Asshole's face. It was a crap gun and it only held one shot but one shot was all I'd need.
"No fighting at The Gathering except for in The Cage" he said calmly.
Dorktown grabbed my arm and pulled it down. "Why would you shoot Bruce?" she asked. "Aren't you two best mates now?" She got out her book and started flipping through the pages.
I was beginning to tire of people treating my book like it was an oracle of truth just because it had the word "nonfictional" in the title. But it was people taking my book seriously that had made this whole festival possible. And Dorktown was technically right. At the end of that book I refrained from killing Mohawk Asshole because we'd become friends in a very roundabout way.
I put the gun away. "It's Tomorrowland Weekend" I said. "And you're not allowed in."
"I'm already in" he said. He pointed at the tape on the ground that I'd relocated earlier that day. Ok he had a point.
"Dammit Ulfsbane" I said.
Ulfsbane looked at the tape and made a confused grunt.
"We're going back to my trailer to catch up. Don't let in any more psychotic killers."
"There goes all your customers" Dorktown said.
We headed back to my trailer.
"Don't you want his autograph too?" I asked Dorktown.
"Already got it" Dorktown replied.
I sat the two of them down and shut the door.
"What the fuck do you want?" I asked.
They both started blabbering.
"You first" I said pointing at Mohawk Asshole.
"Thought I'd pay you a visit. Have a cuppa tea."
"I appreciate the buddy buddy act" I told him. "But we both know it's an act."
"All right then" he said. "Give me my car back and I won't tell anyone your secret."
Dorktown looked at me. "What's your secret?"
I ignored her. I reached into my jacket pocket and took out the old Firebird's VIN plate. I tossed it to Mohawk Asshole. "That's all that's left of the car."
He looked at the VIN plate and started reading aloud. But he wasn't reading the letters and numbers. He remembered what the letters and numbers meant. He was decoding them. He'd loved that car as much as I had. "Pontiac... Trans Am... 2 door coupe... 455 cubic inch 4 barrel V8... 1975...." He paused and looked up before translating the last letter. We both knew it by heart. It was the letter N.
"They ain't never gonna make another car like that again" I said.
"Why not?" Dorktown asked. "Why not make a new Firebird?"
I looked at Dorktown. I looked at Mohawk Asshole.
"Norwood" he said. He got up so fast he knocked over his chair. He ran out the door and started yelling at whoever would listen and also at whoever would not listen.
"There is no Tomorrowland!" he shouted. "Firebird's book is a heap of lies! Nobody can swap timelines!"
"That's the secret?" Dorktown asked. "Nobody can swap timelines?"
At this point I should probably clarify that the reason tomorrowlanders all believed they could come to this event and teleport into an alternate universe known as Tomorrowland did indeed have something to do with that book I wrote.
In the book I claimed it was possible for people to swap places with doppelganger versions of themselves in Tomorrowland. I claimed I'd visited a nonapocalyptic Tomorrowland on multiple occasions by trading places with another version of me I called John. I claimed Mohawk Asshole had vanished into Tomorrowland and left in his place a Mr. Rogers version of himself I called Bruce.
It was all just advertising. I was selling futuristic computers. I never expected anyone would actually believe the computers came from the future.
"Nobody can swap timelines" I said.
"So that was... Mohawk Asshole? Not Bruce?"
"Correct."
Dorktown stood up. "Tomorrowland doesn't exist?"
"It exists in our hearts."
"I came all the way around the world for this."
"Tomorrowland is the friends you made along the way."
"Fuck you" she said. "I can kill him with or without you."
She stormed out.
I followed her out the door and grabbed her by the arm.
"Kill who?" I asked.
A rising tide of crowd noises emanated from the direction of The Cage. I turned to look. It was covered top to bottom with people and the entire structure was leaning to one side.
"I'd tell you if you'd listen to me for one second" Dorktown said.
I turned and looked her in the eye. "Why are you here Dorktown?"
"My name is Torkdown." She held my gaze with fire in her eyes. "And I'm here to kill Mohawk Asshole."
"Why?"
"He killed my pop."
"Who was your pop?"
"You used to call him Messenger Kid."
Just then there was a loud crack and a massive ground shaking thud followed by terrified screams. The Cage had collapsed. I felt the heat of an explosion behind me and Dorktown's face lit up orange.
Neither of us turned.
Neither of us blinked.
Now let me explain who the fuck is Messenger Kid. I refuse to write a flashback because I fucking hate flashbacks. Time moves forward in a linear fashion. I ain't saying I'm happy about that. Especially when it comes to Messenger Kid. But if that's how time moves then stories should damn well move that way too. So I'm just gonna tell it how I remember it.
Back when the world went to shit I found myself stuck in Australia. Messenger Kid was the only friend I had. He was mute but like they say actions speak louder than words. You'll just have to imagine the hijinks and shenanigans. Or read the damn book. Anyway Messenger Kid was the kind of friend who'd risk everything for you and he wouldn't think nothing of it. He saved my ass on more than one occasion. I owed him my life.
"And you came here for my help" I said.
"I thought we had to get Bruce to swap timelines with Mohawk Asshole in Tomorrowland to bring back the real Mohawk Asshole. But now you're telling me that Bruce is the real Mohawk Asshole."
"James Bond once said 'Before setting out on revenge you first dig two graves.'"
"I'll dig as many graves as it takes" she said. "Are you gonna help me or not?"
"I had a chance to kill him once you know."
"Page 129. Why didn't you?"
I couldn't think of any more cool James Bond quotes so I let her go. She whipped her head around and vanished into the darkness.
I ran back to my trailer to grab my axe and then I headed for The Cage.
What used to be The Cage. It was now a heap of wood and metal and flames. I found Johnny and asked him what was up.
As always he shouted enthusiastically. "The Helly killed the Gilly president. The Gillies went nuts and everyone started fighting. The whole thing collapsed to the ground!"
"Was anyone else killed?"
We heard a scream from somewhere inside the wreckage.
Johnny laughed. "I think that's a yes."
Johnny ran off like he knew something I didn't. He left me talking to myself.
"Well that's the end of the damned Helly versus Gilly crap" I said.
I turned around to discover that this was not the end of the damned Helly versus Gilly crap.
The burning Cage was behind me. Closing in on my left and right were two gangs of monsters dressed as squares. There were secretaries with torches and farmers with pitchforks and yodelers with nunchucks.
The Hamburglar led the group on the left. The police officer led the group on the right.
It was late but even the sleeping tomorrowlanders heard the ruckus and peeked out of their camps to find out what was going on. Hundreds of them woke up and joined the mob.
"Part of the solution!" one side chanted while pointing at themselves.
"Part of the problem!" they chanted while pointing at the others.
The other side had a chant of its own. "With us!" they shouted while pointing at themselves.
"Against us!" they shouted while pointing at the others.
I tightened my grip on the axe and took off running through this nightmare gauntlet.
The two fronts went to war and I was stuck in the middle. I got down on my hands and knees and crawled through the foolishness.
"Part of the solution!"
"Part of the problem!"
"Neither. Both. Pardon me. Coming through" I said. A severed finger landed on the ground in front of me.
"With us!"
"Against us!"
"Both. Neither. Excuse me. Sorry" I said.
Once I was through I stood up and ran.
Someone shouted "There he is! The guy who saved the Helly president! Get him!"
I ran for my trailer but when I got there it was up in flames. The fireman was lobbing molotovs. My entire inventory of Firebuddies was destroyed along with the one that I used every day.
Ok so that goal was stuffed. My next goal was to get to my car and get the hell out of here.
I ran around back and hopped into my Pinto Cruising Wagon. 171 cubic inch V6. Original paint. Silver with yellow and orange and purple stripes. The thing looked like sex on wheels but drove like a moose on rollerskates. There wasn't a single dent on it cuz they were famous for exploding on impact. No one had the courage to smash into it. Maybe it was all just media hype but it kept the assholes at bay.
I tried to get it started. I say tried cuz this car was no Firebird. It had one third the torque. One third the horsepower. And it took three times as long to get started.
The angry tomorrowlanders heard me cranking the Pinto and came running around back.
The bloke who'd tried to sell me an insurance policy climbed onto the hood and banged his briefcase on the windscreen. An astronaut was using their helmet to headbutt the side glass. The fireman lobbed another molotov and set the insurance guy on fire.
The engine finally turned over on its own power. I floored it and managed to shake off the flaming insurance guy. His briefcase flew open and papers went everywhere.
Pissed off tomorrowlanders were running in every direction. I was headed for the main gate. My brand new Tomorrowland Weekend sign was on fire. A group of Girl Scouts was rocking the scaffolding back and forth trying to pull it down.
The movie star was arguing with Ulfsbane at the gate. While Ulfsbane was distracted a scary looking deep sea diver in one of those hard shelled diving suits grabbed the Six Million Dollar Man lunchbox with my money in it and hobbled away. Ulfsbane noticed and went after him but the movie star tripped him and he went down.
As I neared the gate the scaffolding finally tipped. I gave it the bejeezus but the car bogged down. Yeah that damn car actually slowed down when you stepped on the throttle. I just could not get that carburetor adjusted right. I lifted up on the pedal and barely made it through the gate just in time to look in the mirror and see my beautiful new sign smash onto the ground. The first ever Tomorrowland Weekend would also be the last.
I stopped the car and got out. I'd put everything I had into this event. Now the whole thing was up in flames. Guess I should have bought that insurance policy.
I heard someone to my left kickstarting a motorbike. I heard someone to my right calling for help.
I looked to my left. It was not just anyone and they were not kickstarting just any motorbike. It was the deep sea diver with my lunchbox full of coins and he was about to escape on a Honda CR250M Elsinore. Just like Steve McQueen rode. I oughta kick his ass then take my lunchbox back and take that groovy motorbike too.
I looked to my right. It was Dorktown and she was trapped under the burning scaffolding that had just fallen.
I looked left again. I looked right again.
Goddammit.
The diver rode off as I chopped away at the scaffolding with my axe.CHAPTER 02: bakersfield

The next morning I borrowed Dorktown's Firebuddy to send a message to someone who might help us.
He didn't just borrow it. He's writing this whole damn book on my Firebuddy. That means I can help write it!!
Stop it Dorktown.
We stopped at the Woolworth's diner in Bakersfield and ordered burgers and malts. I hid my face every time a tomorrowlander passed by.
"What are we sitting around for?" Dorktown asked. "Mohawk Asshole could be in Norwood by now."
"Do you know where Norwood is?" I asked.
Dorktown looked toward the entrance. "Oh my god! Is that her?"
She got up and ran to the door. "Are you Mad Skelli? Can I have your autograph?"
"Mind if I sit down first?" Skelli replied.
Skelli sat down and signed Dorktown's book.
"Isn't she a bit young for you?" Skelli asked.
"She's not my girlfriend" I said.
"I'm his mission partner" Dorktown said.
"She's my one member fan club" I said.
"What do you want?" Skelli asked me.
"I need to borrow some money."
"You're the world's first postapocalyptic millionaire. Why do you need to borrow money from me?"
"You're the world's second postapocalyptic millionaire. Who else am I gonna borrow it from? I spent everything I had turning The Gathering into Tomorrowland Weekend. It's all gone now."
"Fuck Tomorrowland Weekend" Dorktown said. "There is no Tomorrowland. Firebird made it all up."
"That's a relief" Skelli said. "I was worried we were all just figments of John's imagination."
"What matters is Mohawk Asshole killed my pop" Dorktown said. "My pop was a friend of yours you called Messenger Kid."
"Mohawk Asshole... killed Messenger Kid?" Skelli asked. "You're Messenger Kid's... kid?"
"Yeah. And we're going to kill Mohawk Asshole."
"She's going to kill Mohawk Asshole" I said.
Dorktown turned to me. "Why do you think Mohawk Asshole killed my pop?"
I thought about it. Then I looked down at the table. I knew the answer before she said it.
"He was looking for you" Dorktown said.
I'd left Skelli and Messenger Kid behind in Australia when I'd gotten on a boat and returned to the USA 13 years ago. They were the only two people who knew where I'd gone.
I slowly looked up at Skelli.
"Dorktown is my mission partner. We are going to kill Mohawk Asshole."
Skelli nodded and turned to Dorktown. "Your father saved my tits on more than one occasion. I owe him my life. You've inherited my debt. What do you need?"
"Mohawk Asshole is going to Norwood" Dorktown said. "We need money to get there. And weapons to capture him with."
"And money to reopen the Firebird factory" I added.
"I'll give you the money to get to Norwood" Skelli said to Dorktown. "You'll have to figure out weapons on your own."
"And the factory?" I asked.
"Chew on me bloody minge" Skelli replied.
"I thought you two were in love" Dorktown said.
Skelli turned to Dorktown. "First you said you were gonna kill him. Then you said you were gonna capture him. Which is it?"
"First the second. Then the first." Dorktown said. "We're gonna tie him up and then we're gonna drop him out of a helicopter."
"Do you have a helicopter?"
"No. We'll have to borrow one."
"Have you ever killed anyone?" Skelli asked.
"No but I've smashed the skulls of dead kangaroos. Can't be much different."
"It's different."
"You killed Fake Cop right?" Dorktown asked. She was referring to Skelli's ex who was also Mohawk Asshole's best mate.
"I did it to save a life. Not for revenge. When we returned to put petrol in the Firebird we buried his body. You can't let a crazy world make you go crazy too."
Skelli might never admit she said all that but I assure you she did.
"Why not?" Dorktown asked.
A man came to the table and asked if we were enjoying the food.
"Yes!" Dorktown exclaimed. "Great place. Are you the owner? I wanna ask you something." She got up and walked with him to the cash register.
"Sweet kid" Skelli said.
"She's a psychopath" I replied.
Dorktown pointed at a vintage Barnett Wildcat crossbow that was hanging on the wall. The shop owner took it down and handed it to her. She admired it for a moment. She said a few more words and smiled. The owner reached under the counter and handed her a single arrow.
"I thought she didn't have any money" Skelli said.
I chuckled. "She doesn't."
Dorktown returned to the table and showed off her new toy. "We'll use this to capture him. We'll find a helicopter later."
We left the diner. Skelli discreetly handed a sack of coins to Dorktown. They exchanged a few words I couldn't hear. Then Skelli skedattled.
Firebird forgot to mention that Skelli gave him a kiss goodbye. They're in love!!
Goddammit Dorktown. If you're gonna chime in at least give us some useful information. What did Skelli whisper to you?
She said "If you fuck him I'll smash your pretty little toes with a hammer."
Skelli definitely did not say that.
We headed over to the Pinto.
"Can I drive?" Dorktown asked.
"Nobody drives my car" I said. We got in and started off.
"Norwood?" she asked.
"Van Nuys."CHAPTER 03: VAN NUYS

Not many people have written books in the past 38 years. Every book that gets written nowadays kinda has to be a history book and a philosophy book and a survival book too. So I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't tell you what I know about how things got to be the way they are and maybe offer some ideas about how to get things back to the way they oughta be.
Wait why are we going to Van Nuys??
I'll get to that but there's something else I want to write about first.
I hope you're gonna go on a rant about economics. That was my favorite part of the last book!!
It makes me so happy to hear that! I was worried that....
Wait you're being sarcastic aren't you. Listen. This is important. Economics is the choices we make every day. The choices we make change our lives and the lives of those around us. The choices we make change the world. So economics is the study of how to change the world. Stop fucking up my (our) book.
I'm (we're) writing this book in what we call the Year 38. The reason we call it Year 38 is cuz the Big Bang happened 38 years ago. That was Year Zero.
The world used to be a much swankier place. I'm a prewar so I should know. I was there. Mohawk Asshole was there too. Skelli and Dorktown were postwars.
The Big Bang wasn't just a war. There were diseases and pests and disasters both natural and unnatural. By the time it was over the governments of the world had all bombed themselves out of existence and something like 95% of humanity was gone too.
Imagine you're one of the survivors. Imagine you work in the Norwood factory building Trans Ams. If you showed up for work and 95% of your coworkers were gone could you keep building cars? No way. That's why no one's built a new car in 38 years.
But now imagine you the kind of person who works on cars in your garage. Imagine you need an alternator. For every car that has an owner there are now 19 cars sitting around that don't.
Why steal when you can scavenge? Why fight when you can cooperate?
Now you're beginning to understand how some of us managed to keep the world spinning despite the assholes' best efforts.
The Big Bang took away everything it could take. But it couldn't take away our grit or guff or gumption or good old-fashioned American ingenuity. Yeah people are ingenious all over the world but back in the days before the Big Bang everyone came to America to be ingenious. The USA was the most prosperous country in history.
The human brain has a thing called negativity bias. We focus on the bad stuff to ensure that threats don't get the better of us. So it was easy for people like Howard Zinn to catalog all the things that the USA got wrong. Yeah I read that book and yeah I get it.
But the problem with negativity bias is that it makes us take the good stuff for granted. So what's not so easy is figuring out what exactly it was that the USA got right. If I was gonna put the world back together I had to make sure I put it back together right.
So what if Tomorrowland Weekend was fake? I really was trying to rebuild the world. I was gonna give people the real Tomorrowland. The computers I was selling were only the beginning. One day those computers are gonna fit in your pocket. We'll have skyscrapers with working elevators. Muscle cars that make more power and drink less petrol. Jets and satellites in the sky again. A city on the moon and then we'll head for Mars.
It was only a matter of time plus the ingenuity of clever cunts like me. Inventing shit. Improving shit. Making money by earning it. Not stealing it. The only way we'd get to Tomorrowland was if we built it ourselves.
You probably think I'm a moneygrubbing monster who would have gone after that deep sea diver who grabbed my Six Million Dollar Man lunchbox if only Dorktown had been a bloke and not a sheila. You can think that if you want.
But I will not let you think for a moment that I don't have dreams. I will not let you think for a moment that I don't care about the greater good. My entire life has been devoted to rebuilding the world. Who says you have to suffer and sacrifice? If I can save the world and have a good time doing it then that's all the better. Maybe I'll even make some money along the way.
When I invented the Firebuddy I opened up new worldwide communication channels and brought back TV and movies and made money digital. Now I was gonna bring back cars. Shiny fucking Trans Ams with big fucking birds painted on the hoods. Don't even try to act like you don't want one.
I do want one!! But can we please get back to the fighting and killing??

"Van Nuys? What the fuck?" Dorktown asked. "We have to get to Norwood."
"Pontiac Firebirds were assembled in two locations" I said. "Norwood Ohio and Van Nuys California. Van Nuys is only two hours away. If Mohawk Asshole has half a brain he'll be headed there first."
"How much of a brain does he have?"
"He's not as dumb as he looks and sounds and thinks and acts."
Dorktown got out her book again and started flipping through it.
"What are you doing?"
"If we've got an hour then I've got more questions."
"Ok."
"Did Skelli know all along that Tomorrowland wasn't real?"
"She never even heard of Tomorrowland until my book came out last year."
"What about that scene where she witnessed you swapping timelines?"
"I made it up."
She laughed. "You're an asshole."
"I'm a storyteller."
"No you're not. I know for a fact that half your book is true. I just don't know which half. How did you survive your encounter with the grieving woman who wanted revenge?"
"I grabbed her gun and shot her."
"Did you ever really find out what was on the movie film in your parents' safe?"
I pulled off at an old servo in Castaic that looked like it might still be in business. The joint was called Gallion's Gallons. "We gotta get some petrol. Get out your bag of coins."
"No wait! I'm not done! Did you know where Deadline was the whole time?"
I winked at her. Then I got out of the car and went in to look for signs of life.
He didn't really wink at me. He answered my question. But I'm not telling any of you fuckers what he said!!
Dorktown found my JVC RC-M90 cassette player and Koss PRO-4A headphones in the back seat and tried them out.
I found a bloke inside who agreed to sell us some petrol. Full service just like the old days. He filled up the Pinto and checked the oil and wiped down the windshield. He damn well ought to at these prices.
"She's paying" I said. "Where's the dunny?"
"Huh?"
"The restroom."
"Around the side."
I headed around the building and tugged on the door. Locked.
"Just a minute" a muffled voice said.
I paced around for a moment before I noticed the front wheel and fender of a motorbike peeking around from behind the building. I knew that fender by heart because I'd sat in class drawing that motorbike over and over when I was a kid. I spent hours trying to get that damn fender right. Honda CR250M Elsinore. Just like Steve McQueen rode. It was the goddamn deep sea diver's bike.
The toilet flushed. Fuck.
I found an old rusty modular shelving unit and pushed it up against the restroom door.
"Dorktown!" I shouted.
No response.
"Dorktown!"
Nothing.
I ran around front while the diver struggled to push his way out of the restroom. Dorktown was still listening to music. I snatched the headphones off of her.
"What the fuck?" she asked.
"It's him!"
"Mohawk Asshole?" She got out and went for her crossbow.
"No. The asshole who stole my Six Million Dollar Man lunchbox!"
"Lunchbox? Jesus fuck. I'll buy you another lunch."
"No my lunchbox full of money!" I tried to grab her crossbow but she held on tight.
"You have a gun. Go shoot him."
He'd almost bashed his way out of the restroom. I ran back to the door and held it in place. I pulled out my Liberator and twisted the cocking knob into place. I pointed it into the doorway.
"Give me back my lunchbox you chum dumpster!" I yelled.
That's right. This asshole just earned himself a nickname.
Chumdumpster braced himself against the opposite wall and kicked the door as hard as he could. The shelving unit fell over with me under it.
He pushed his way out of the restroom. He had my lunchbox in his hand. He climbed on top of the shelving unit and trapped me under it.
I couldn't breathe.
"Dorktown..." I gasped.
I could see his face laughing through the thick glass of  his helmet.
"Help...."
I stuck my gun against his metal suit and pulled the trigger. The Liberator's spot welds all blew out and it cracked in half in my hand. I have no idea if the bullet actually left the chamber but if it did Chumdumpster sure as hell didn't notice.
He got up and waddled over to his bike. I could tell he wasn't wearing a fully functional waterproof suit because he had on motorbike gloves and boots. He put my lunchbox into his saddlebag and came back with a rope.
He tied the rope around my foot which was stuck under the shelves. He tied the other end to his bike and started it up.
He pulled away slowly to tighten up the slack. He stopped and turned around to watch me squirm. Then he revved the engine and pulled away hard.
He yanked me out from under the shelves and dragged me across the bitumen.
Everything was a blur but I did see the servo owner briefly turn to look at me as I slid across the ground. He then turned back around to finish wiping down the Pinto's windscreen.
The bike turned onto the road and picked up speed.
I did my best to curl into a ball and sit up so I could get my hands on the rope around my foot. I couldn't untie it. The knot was getting tighter and tighter the further he dragged me.
That didn't work so I grabbed the rope and pulled myself forward so the rope wasn't pulling on my leg so hard. I managed to get the rope under my foot and crush it between my foot and the road. It was like being pulled behind a truck on a skateboard. I should know. I did that once. Only this time there was no skateboard.
We must have been going a hundred kays. The rope started smoking. Finally the rope snapped. I slid into a ditch and Chumdumpster rode off.
I had blood all over me and my jeans were full of holes. I got the rope off my foot and walked back to the servo.
Dorktown looked up and took off the headphones.
"How'd you do?" she asked.
"My gun broke."
"What happened to all the other guns you wrote about in your book?"
"They got bent up when my car got smashed. Why didn't you come after me when I was being dragged down the road?"
"You looked like you had it under control. And you told me never to drive your car!" she said.
"New rule. You can drive my car if it's an emergency."
"Me drive Pinto! Me drive Pinto!"
"Only in an emergency. And there aren't going to be any more emergencies."
I got in the car and started it up. Then I remembered something. I turned to face her.
"If you do drive the car don't hit anything."
"Why not?"
"Pintos are famous for exploding. Ok?"
"Exploding car. Got it."
"What are you listening to?" I asked.
She grabbed the cassette box. It was a mixtape my dad had made for me when I was a kid. "The Rolling Stones" she said. "Shattered. Live Fort Worth 1978."
"Keith Richards is still alive you know."
"Who's Keith Richards?"
The servo owner shrugged and counted his money as we drove off.

When we arrived in Van Nuys we spotted an old man selling carburetors out of an old cart. I pulled over to talk to him.
"I'm Firebird. This is Dorktown."
"Oldkoot" he said.
"G'day Oldkoot. You got any carbs that might fit this V6?"
"This ain't much of a Ford town. But I think I got one that would fit."
I turned off the car and we got out while he dug up the carburetor. I tossed Dorktown an ancient piece of grape Bubble Yum from my stash. She unwrapped it and put it in her mouth. Her eyes lit up in delight.
The carb had clearly been rebuilt with care. Clean as a whistle. New handcut gaskets and everything.
"Did you rebuild this?" I asked.
"Yes sir."
"Mind if I try it out?"
"Go right ahead."
I got to work putting it on. "It looks great. How long have you been doing this kind of thing?"
"I've been building engines for dang near 50 years now. I worked at the old plant when it was in its prime."
"That's where we're headed. Can you give us directions?"
"It's just a few blocks that way. But you don't want to go there now."
"What do you mean? What happened?"
"I was refurbishing and selling old parts out of the place. There were other vendors there too.  We had a little flea market going. Yesterday some fopdoodle showed up and started acting like he owned the place."
"A fopdoodle with a mohawk?"
"Yep. Then some gollumpus joined him."
"A gollumpus in an old timey dive suit?"
"Yep. They stole my handbuilt turbo V8 and kicked everyone out. What are they up to?"
"They're trying to build a whole new Trans Am. You think there might be enough spare parts in the place to do it?"
"There are still some subframes sitting around. Some sheet metal. No glass. Not enough parts to make a complete car. But you could probably use the parts to get a frankencar up and running."
"Any more of the original plant workers still around?"
"A bomb hit the plant in '81. A bunch of workers were killed. I lost two friends. Eventually everyone gave up or faded away. I reckon I'm the last one left. The world ain't what it used to be."
Dorktown walked over to us. "Don't worry" she said between smacks of her gum. "We're gonna fix the world and kill the assholes that broke it."
I turned and pointed at her. "Thattagirl!" I said.
She smiled and swallowed her gum.
I put the air cleaner on and started up the Pinto. I revved it up. It sounded stronger than it had ever sounded before.
"Sounds great. What do we owe you?" I asked.
"You help me get those vermin out of my plant and we're even."
"It's a deal. How many of them are in there?"
"I couldn't rightly say. Their cronies have been carrying parts in and out all day. There are guards out front. But we don't have to go in the front."
He reached into his pocket and pulled out a single key on an old GM keychain.
"We'll go in tonight" I said.
"Fuck that" Dorktown said.
She pulled the crossbow out of the Pinto and grabbed the key from Oldkoot. I grabbed her wrist and pried the key from her fingers.
"Keep it" she said. "I'll go in through the front." She strutted off in the direction of the plant.
I took off after her. She started running. I  chased her and tackled her. We both went down with the crossbow underneath us.
She got up and looked at the crossbow. The bow was now bent out of shape. She threw it aside. "Fuck it. I'll tear off his skin with my fingernails if I have to."
I blocked her path. She tried to push her way through me.
"Dorktown please listen to me."
I took shoves and punches and kicks and scratches but I held fast.
"Please. Dorktown."
Now she was screaming and wailing.
"Listen to me. Torkdown.... Torkdown!" Yeah I said her real name. She looked up at me.
Dorktown was crying.
Firebird was crying too.
Some things are better left unsaid.
This isn't one of those things.
"If you die there won't be anyone in my fan club" I said. "We have to wait until dark. We'll go in tonight."
She gasped a few times and then looked down at the sidewalk. I put my arm around her and we walked back to the car.
