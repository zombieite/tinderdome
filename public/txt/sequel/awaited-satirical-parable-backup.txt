CHAPTER 00: tomorrowland

The old sign came down as the new one went up. The old sign read "The Gathering." The new sign read "Tomorrowland Weekend."
"Tomorrowland Weekend! Where the Big Bang never happened!" Carnival barking isn't my style so I paid some motherfucker to shout for me. I called him Johnny Olson after that bloke who used to shout "A new car!" on The Price Is Right. "You are awaited at Tomorrowland Weekend!"
The Gathering used to be this free event in the California desert where lost souls came from all over the world to meet up with family and friends or whatever. But this year I'd bought out the whole damn thing and jazzed it up to look like a nonapocalyptic parallel universe I called Tomorrowland.
"Tomorrowland Weekend!" Johnny Olson barked. "Where there is no suffering! No hunger! No war! No politics! Where all the shoes have shoelaces. Where all the cars have guzzoline. Where the streets are paved with asphalt!"
Hundreds of motherfuckers were lined up at the gate and I was the gatekeeper. To get into Tomorrowland Weekend you had to.... well I'll let Johnny explain it.
"Costumes and Firebuddy required for entry!" he screamed. "If you do not have a Firebuddy you can buy one at the door."
The Firebuddy was a "laptop" computer I'd invented. I called it a laptop cuz it was small enough to fit on your lap. It was Firebuddy sales that had paid for this whole damn festival. Costumes were required so that when you came to Tomorrowland Weekend you'd feel like you'd really entered a parallel universe where the bombs had never fallen. People built fake little office buildings or flower shops or libraries or whatever and pretended that life was beautiful and boring.
At the front of the line stood an impeccably-dressed man. Suit and tie and hat and everything. It was Year 38 now so I was damn sure it had been 38 years since I'd seen a bloke dressed up that nice. I remembered being a kid seeing my dad off to work and he'd be dressed like that.
"What are you supposed to be?" I asked.
"I'm an insurance salesman! Hi. How are ya. Nice weather we're having. Can I interest you in a policy of insurance?" He handed me his business card.
"Nailing it. Where'd you get the suit?"
"Found it in a bunker."
"Far out." I said. He showed me his Firebuddy and I waved him in. "The briefcase is a nice touch."
Next guy had on a red hat and a yellow coat. He carried an axe. He offered me a metal bucket full of coins but I stopped him.
"Nice fireman gettup. That axe is in great shape mate."
"The head's a little loose."
He handed it to me so I could take a closer look. "Looks all right." I said. "Wanna keep your shrapnel and barter me this instead?"
He took me up on the deal. He gave me the axe and his business card. I handed him a Firebuddy.
A woman in a homemade blue uniform was next.
"What are you?" I asked.
"I'm a police officer!" she said enthusiastically. "Have you done any crimes?"
"Crimes against humanity!" I replied.
"Remain silent!" she chuckled.
She handed me a framed twenty dollar bill pressed between two sheets of plexiglass. Ugh.
"You don't have coins?" I asked.
"This is all I've got."
"You're gonna have to take it out of there. And you're not getting change." Nowadays most people were using Firebucks which was a computerized currency I'd come up with. But to use Firebucks you had to have a Firebuddy or some other kind of computer like a DingoDongle or an Assholebuddy. Nice part was over time the computer could generate new Firebucks using nothing but electricity and maths. In a year or two your computer would pay for itself. Now you get why so many people were standing in line.
The police officer put the frame on the ground and borrowed my axe to break it open. She handed the axe back to me. "Head's a little loose" she said.
She carefully pulled the sheets of plastic apart and handed me the bill. I handed her a Firebuddy.
She started walking away but stopped and turned back. "Almost forgot" she said. "Here's my business card."
I had a little table set up with two of my childhood lunchboxes on it. The business cards went into my Pac Man lunchbox. The money went into my Six Million Dollar Man lunchbox. Both of them were overflowing.
One sheila was dressed as a construction worker. One bloke was a race car driver. There was a politician. A doctor. There was even someone dressed up as a thief but he just reminded me of the Hamburglar. The prewars were living out their stolen childhood dreams. The postwars were dreaming of a world they'd never known.
"Are you Firebird?" a teenage girl asked. She had an Australian accent.
"Used to be" I said. "That car was smashed to bits. Now I drive a 77 Ford Pinto. Might have to be known as Pinto from now on. What are you supposed to be? A homeless orphan? You can't wear that here. It breaks immersion."
"Will you sign my book?" she asked. She handed me a copy of a book I'd written a little while back:

AWAITED: NONFICTIONAL DELUSION

"Make it out to Torkdown."
"Dorktown?"
"Torkdown."
"To... Dorktown...." I scribbled my name.
"How can I get to Tomorrowland?" she asked.
"Buy a Firebuddy like everyone else" I told her.
"Not Tomorrowland Weekend" the girl said. "The real Tomorrowland. Like in your book."
A lot of people had read that book and taken it a bit too seriously. A lot of people had gotten it into their heads that Tomorrowland was a real place you could visit. That's what gave me the idea for Tomorrowland Weekend. Tomorrowland Weekend wouldn't just be a party in the desert. It would be a chance to live in the world of my book. It would be a lifestyle. An identity. A culture. A family. We were no longer merely attendees of the Gathering or Tomorrowland Weekend. We were tomorrowlanders. We were gonna rebuild the world and this time we were gonna do it right. But it was gonna take work. Some of these lazy fucks thought they could jump out of this world and into a better one just by changing their clothes. And this girl hadn't even bothered to do that.
"You gotta buy a Firebuddy." I told her. I was really trying to emphasize that part. "You gotta dress up. Then I let you in. While you're in there maybe... maybe you swap timelines with another version of yourself and you teleport into the real Tomorrowland. Maybe not. Maybe you just buy a computer and go home. Now you're holding up the line. You buying a Firebuddy or what?"
"I don't have any money" she said.
"Ulfsbane!" I shouted.
My hired hunk appeared and grabbed the problem child.
"Take her to the highway and let her hitchhike back to Australia."
At that moment a skirmish broke out in line and Ulfsbane let the girl run off. Me and Ulfsbane and a heap of other motherfuckers surrounded the assholes who were fighting.
The race car driver and the politician had knives in their hands and they had the construction worker on the ground. He was unarmed. They'd already cut him up good and they were about to finish the job.
"Show us what he looks like on the inside!" somebody shouted.
But then some other bloke shouted "No fighting at The Gathering except for in The Cage!"
The fighting paused and all eyes turned to me. I hated making decisions like this but I put on my best authoritative badass face.
"There ain't no laws anymore but that don't mean there ain't no rules" I said. "It's not The Gathering anymore. It's Tomorrowland Weekend. But the rule still holds."
"You don't get it" the race car driver explained. "He's a Helly."
Someone shouted "Kill all Hellies."
I turned to Ulfsbane. "What's a Helly?"
Talking to Ulfsbane was pretty much like talking to a hole in the ground. He grunted.
The politician added "And we're not inside The Gathering yet." He pointed to some orange tape I'd nailed to the ground beneath the sign.
I had to think fast if I didn't want a dead body stinking up the line. I went over to the tape on the ground and pulled it up and away from the entrance gate. I unspooled some more and walked it around the fighting fuckers and back to the gate. I put a couple new nails into the ground to hold the tape in its new position.
"Welcome to Tomorrowland Weekend" I said to the three of them.
"See you in The Cage Helly" the race car driver said to the bleeding construction worker. He and the politician threw their money at me and grabbed Firebuddies from the stack. Then they both went digging in their pockets and pulled out business cards so they could ceremoniously throw them at me too.
The construction worker got up and showed me his Firebuddy. "You did the right thing" he said. "Me and you? We're on the winning side of history."
"I'm not on any side of history" I replied.
He laughed. "Then you're part of the problem. That's the one thing Hellies and Gillies can agree on."
He handed me his card and walked away. The card was covered in blood. It read "Bartholomu Chocula. President Of The Hellies. Death to Gillies."
"What's a Gilly?" I asked Ulfsbane.
Ulfsbane grunted.
The sheila who was dressed as a doctor was next in line.
"That man needs medical attention" I said.
Her eyes narrowed over her surgical mask. "When you saved that man's life you sent a message loud and clear that you want to erase the existence of people like me."
"What kind of a person are you?" I asked.
"It's time you asked yourself that question" she hissed.

"Welcome to the first ever Tomorrowland Weekend!" I shouted into the megaphone from the center of The Cage.
Night had fallen. The race car driver was on one side of The Cage and the construction worker was on the other. I handed swords to both of them.
Hundreds of people stood outside The Cage screaming and cheering and banging on the fence. I gestured for them to quiet down.
"People have come from all over the world to be here tonight. Some of us are here to find thems we're looking for and thems we've lost. Some of us are here to make money. Some of us are here to have a good time. But all of us are here because we want to build a better tomorrow!" I paused for a big cheer but it wasn't as big as I'd hoped.
"Death to Gillies!" someone shouted.
"Kill all Hellies!" someone retorted.
"Death comes soon enough!" I said. "It doesn't matter if you're a Helly or a Gilly. We are all tomorrowlanders!" Again the crowd was not enthused. It was time to give them what they wanted.
"When you're trying to get by in a world gone crazy sometimes you gotta go a little crazy too. I bet dollars to donuts every one of us here tonight has killed someone at some point in their lives. Ever since the first great Gathering 38 years ago there have been Cage matches to resolve conflicts like this. Tonight Tomorrowland Weekend continues this storied tradition!"
Now the crowd was getting worked up. A little too much maybe. The whole Cage was shaking.
"Death to Gillies!" half of them shouted.
"Kill all Hellies!" half of them replied.
Might as well run with it. "Tonight it's a war driving Gilly versus the joefficial schmoefficial president of the Hellies!" I said. "Let the battle begin!"
The crowd went mad and I got the hell out of there. I handed the megaphone to Johnny on the way out.
"You're not gonna stay and watch? This one's gonna be good" he said.
"I got work to do."
I went back to my trailer and fired up my Firebuddy. The Firebuddy would automatically connect to other nearby computers and let you communicate with them. When you bought a Firebuddy it came with free access to a "social networking website" I'd built called You Are Awaited.
The messages people posted on You Are Awaited used to be hopeful and friendly and positive. But lately things were different. People had started posting things like "If you're a Gilly we can't be friends" and "Hellies should be lined up and shot." I scrolled through the messages. There was no end to the vitriol.
My algorithm had noticed that people wanted to talk about this stuff so it had encouraged them. What had I done?CHAPTER 01: dorktown

There was a knock at the door. I opened it. It was Dorktown.
"You again? Ulfsbane!" I shouted.
"No wait" she said. "I have a Firebuddy now. Ulfsbane let me in." She showed me her new laptop.
"I thought you didn't have any money."
"I don't."
"How'd you get a Firebuddy?"
"Somebody gave me one."
"You still look like a ragamuffin."
"What are you supposed to be? Cowboy hat and leather jacket?"
"I'm a software engineer named John Binns who's attending a postapocalyptic festival called Wasteland Weekend."
She giggled.
"Why are you here?" I asked.
"I need to talk to you about Tomorrowland. But first I have a surprise."
"I hate surprises. Just tell me what it is."
"A friend of yours is here to see you."
"I don't have any friends."
"Yes you do. You wrote about him in your book. Ulfsbane won't let him in even though he has a Firebuddy."
I thought about everyone I'd written about in my book. Dorktown was from Australia. I was only friends with one bloke out there. Could it be... Messenger Kid?
"All right let's go."
When we stepped outside I looked over at The Cage. Some people had climbed up the sides and onto the top. The entire structure was rocking back and forth. The crowd hooted and hollered like a pack of hungry animals. Maybe tonight this Hellies and Gillies stuff would be decided once and for all and I'd never have to hear about it again.
We headed away from The Cage toward the Tomorrowland Weekend entrance gate. The light was broken and Ulfsbane was messing with the bulb. All I could see was the silhouette of a man who was definitely not Messenger Kid.
We were just a few feet away when the light suddenly flickered on and lit up his face.
"G'day mate!" said a maniacal grinning mohawked head wearing a goddamn tuxedo.
I leaped back in terror and fell to the ground. "Jesus fucking christ" I said. Did I mention he was wearing a tuxedo?
Dorktown giggled. "I found Bruce!" she said.
Yeah his real name was Bruce but I referred to him as Mohawk Asshole. The name is kinda dumb but I gave it to him when I was ten so what can I say. He got his first name cuz he had a mohawk. He got his last name cuz he killed my family.
And if you're wondering how I got the name Firebird it's cuz I stole Mohawk Asshole's Firebird Trans Am on the day he killed my family and drove it around for a few decades.
I got up and pulled out my FP45 Liberator. It was a crap gun and it only held one shot but one shot was all I'd need.
"What makes you think I won't shoot you in the face?" I asked.
"No fighting at The Gathering except for in The Cage" he answered.
"It's Tomorrowland Weekend. And you're not allowed in."
"I'm already in" he said. He pointed at the tape on the ground that I'd relocated earlier that day. Ok he had a point.
"Dammit Ulfsbane!" I said.
Ulfsbane looked at the tape and made a confused grunt.
Dorktown grabbed my arm and pulled the gun down. "Why would you shoot Bruce? Aren't you two best mates now?" She got out her book and started flipping through the pages.
I was beginning to tire of people treating my book like it was an oracle of truth just because it had the word "nonfictional" in the title. But it was people taking my book seriously that had made this whole festival possible. And Dorktown was technically right. At the end of that book I refrained from killing Mohawk Asshole because we'd become friends... in a very roundabout way.
"Ulfsbane don't let any more psychotic killers in."
"There goes all your customers" Dorktown said.
Me and Dorktown and Mohawk Asshole headed back to my trailer.
"Don't you want his autograph too?" I asked Dorktown.
"Already got it" Dorktown replied.
On the way there a passerby dressed as a baseball player stopped in his tracks and saluted Mohawk Asshole. I dunno what that was about.
I sat the two of them down and shut the door.
"What the fuck do you want?" I asked.
They both started blabbering.
"You first" I said pointing at Mohawk Asshole.
"Thought I'd pay you a visit. Have a cuppa tea."
"I appreciate the buddy-buddy act" I told him. "But we both know it's an act."
"All right then" he said. "Give me my car back and I won't tell anyone your secret."
Dorktown looked at me. "What's your secret?"
I ignored her. I reached into my jacket pocket and took out the old Firebird's VIN plate. I tossed it to Mohawk Asshole. "That's all that's left of the car."
He looked at the VIN plate and started reading aloud. But he wasn't reading the letters and numbers. He remembered what the letters and numbers meant. He was decoding them. He'd loved that car as much as I had. "Pontiac... Trans Am... 2 door coupe... 455 cubic inch 4 barrel V8... 1975...." He paused and looked up before translating the last letter. We both knew it by heart. It was the letter N.
"They ain't never gonna make another car like that again" I said.
"Why not?" Dorktown asked. "Why not make a new Firebird?"
I looked at Dorktown. I looked at Mohawk Asshole.
"Norwood" he said. He got up so fast he knocked over his chair. He ran out the door and started yelling at whoever would listen and also at whoever would not listen.
"There is no Tomorrowland!" he shouted. "Firebird's book is a heap of lies! Nobody can swap timelines!"
"That's the secret?" Dorktown asked. "Nobody can swap timelines?"
At this point I should probably clarify that the reason tomorrowlanders all believed they could come to this event and teleport into an alternate universe known as Tomorrowland did indeed have something to do with that book I wrote.
In the book I claimed it was possible for people to swap places with doppelganger versions of themselves in Tomorrowland. I claimed I'd switched back and forth between these timelines and visited a nonapocalyptic Tomorrowland on multiple occasions. I claimed Mohawk Asshole had vanished into Tomorrowland and left in his place a Mr. Rogers version of himself named Bruce.
It was all just advertising. I was selling futuristic computers. I never expected anyone would actually believe the computers came from the future.
"Nobody can swap timelines" I said.
"So that was... Mohawk Asshole? Not Bruce?"
"Correct."
Dorktown stood up. "Tomorrowland doesn't exist?"
"It exists in our hearts."
"I came all the way around the world for this."
"Tomorrowland is the friends you made along the way."
"Fuck you" she said. "I can kill him with or without you."
She stormed out.
I followed her out the door and caught up to her and grabbed her by the arm.
"Kill who?" I asked.
A rising tide of crowd noises emanated from the direction of The Cage. I turned to look. It was covered top to bottom with people and the entire structure was leaning to one side.
"I'd tell you if you'd listen to me for one second" Dorktown said.
I turned and looked her in the eye. "Why are you here Dorktown?"
"My name is Torkdown." She held my gaze with fire in her eyes. "And I'm here to kill Mohawk Asshole."
"Why?"
"He killed my pop."
"Who was your pop?"
"You used to call him Messenger Kid."
Just then there was a loud crack and a massive ground shaking thud followed by terrified screams. The Cage had collapsed. I felt the heat of an explosion behind me and Dorktown's face lit up orange.
Neither of us turned.
Neither of us blinked.
Now let me explain who the fuck is Messenger Kid. I refuse to write a flashback because I fucking hate flashbacks. Time moves forward in a linear fashion. I ain't saying I'm happy about that. Especially when it comes to Messenger Kid. But if that's how time moves then stories should damn well move that way too. So I'm just gonna tell it how I remember it.
Back when the world went to shit I found myself stuck in Australia. Messenger Kid was the only friend I had. You'll just have to imagine the hijinks and shenanigans. Or read the damn book. Anyway Messenger Kid was the kind of friend who'd risk everything for you and he wouldn't think nothing of it. He saved my ass on more than one occasion. I owed him my life.
"And you came here for my help" I said.
"I thought we had to get Bruce to swap timelines with Mohawk Asshole in Tomorrowland to bring back the real Mohawk Asshole. But now you're telling me that Bruce is the real Mohawk Asshole."
"James Bond once said 'Before setting out on revenge you first dig two graves.'"
"I'll dig as many graves as it takes" she said. "Are you gonna help me or not?"
"I had a chance to kill him once you know."
"Page 129. Why didn't you?"
I couldn't think of any more cool James Bond quotes so I let her go. She whipped her head around and vanished into the darkness.
I ran back to my trailer to grab my axe and then I headed for The Cage.
What used to be The Cage. It was now a heap of wood and metal and flames. I found Johnny and asked him what was up.
As always he shouted enthusiastically like a game show announcer. "The Gilly killed the Helly president. The Hellies went nuts and everyone started fighting. The whole thing collapsed to the ground!"
"Was anyone else killed?"
We heard a scream from somewhere inside the wreckage.
Johnny laughed. "I think that's a yes."
Johnny ran off like he knew something I didn't. He left me talking to myself.
"Well that's the end of the damned Helly versus Gilly crap" I said.
I turned around to discover that this was not the end of the damned Helly versus Gilly crap.
The burning Cage was behind me. Closing in on my left and right were two gangs of monsters dressed as squares. There were secretaries with torches and farmers with pitchforks and yodelers with nunchucks.
The Hamburglar led the group on the left. The police officer led the group on the right.
It was late but even the sleeping tomorrowlanders heard the ruckus and peeked out of their camps to find out what was going on. Hundreds of them woke up and joined the mob.
"Part of the solution!" one side chanted while pointing at themselves.
"Part of the problem!" they chanted while pointing at the others.
The other side had a chant of its own. "With us!" they shouted while pointing at themselves.
"Against us!" they shouted while pointing at the others.
I tightened my grip on the axe and took off running through this nightmare gauntlet.
The two fronts went to war and I was stuck in the middle. I got down on my hands and knees and crawled through the foolishness.
"Part of the solution!"
"Part of the problem!"
"Neither. Both. Pardon me. Coming through" I said.
"With us!"
"Against us!"
"Both. Neither. Excuse me. Sorry" I said.
Once I was through I stood up and ran.
Someone shouted "There he is! The guy who saved the Helly president! Get him!"
Someone else shouted "It's the guy who sent the Helly president to die in The Cage! Kill that asshole."
I ran for my trailer but when I got there it was up in flames. The fireman was lobbing molotovs. My entire inventory of Firebuddies was destroyed along with the one that I used every day.
Ok so that goal was stuffed. My next goal was to get to my car and get the hell out of here.
I ran around back and hopped into my Pinto Cruising Wagon. Silver with yellow and orange and purple stripes. The thing looked like sex on wheels but drove like a moose on rollerskates..
I tried to get it started. I say tried cuz this car was no Firebird. It had one third the torque. One third the horsepower. And it took three times as long to get started.
The angry tomorrowlanders heard me cranking the Pinto and came running around back.
The bloke who'd tried to sell me an insurance policy climbed onto the hood and banged his briefcase on the windscreen. A deep sea diver was using their helmet to headbutt the side glass. The fireman lobbed another molotov and set the insurance guy on fire.
The engine finally turned over on its own power. I floored it and managed to shake off the flaming insurance guy. His briefcase flew open and papers went everywhere.
Pissed off tomorrowlanders were running in every direction. I was headed for the main gate. My brand new Tomorrowland Weekend sign was on fire. A group of Girl Scouts was rocking the scaffolding back and forth trying to pull it down.
The politician was arguing with Ulfsbane at the gate. While Ulfsbane was distracted an astronaut grabbed the Six Million Dollar Man lunchbox full of shrapnel and took off. Ulfsbane started to go after him but the politician tripped him.
As I neared the gate the scaffolding finally tipped. I gave it the bejeezus but the car bogged down. Yeah that damn car actually slowed down when you stepped on the throttle. I just could not get that carburetor adjusted right. I lifted up on the pedal and barely made it through the gate just in time to look in the mirror and see my beautiful new sign smash onto the ground. The first ever Tomorrowland Weekend would also be the last.
I stopped the car and got out. I'd put everything I had into this event. Now the whole thing was up in flames. Guess I should have bought that insurance policy.
I heard someone to my left trying to kickstart a motorbike. It was not just anyone and it was not just any motorbike. It was the astronaut with my lunchbox full of coins and he was about to escape on a Honda CR250M Elsinore just like Steve McQueen rode. I oughta kick his ass then take my lunchbox back and take his motorbike too.
But I also heard someone to my right calling for help. It was Dorktown trapped under the burning scaffolding.
I looked left. I looked right.
Goddammit.
The astronaut rode off as I chopped away at the scaffolding with my axe.
CHAPTER 02: bakersfield

I borrowed Dorktown's Firebuddy so I could send a message to someone who might help us.
He didn't just borrow it. He's writing his whole damn book on it. That means I can help!
Stop it Dorktown.
We stopped at the Woolworth's diner in Bakersfield and ordered burgers and malts. I hid my face every time a tomorrowlander passed by.
"What are we sitting around for?" Dorktown asked. "Mohawk Asshole is getting away. He could be in Norwood by now."
"Do you know where Norwood is?" I asked.
Dorktown shrugged then looked at the entrance. "Oh my god! Is that her?"
She got up and ran to the door. "Are you Mad Skelli? Can I have your autograph?"
"Mind if I sit down first?" Skelli replied.
Skelli sat down and signed Dorktown's book.
"Isn't she a bit young for you?"
"She's not my girlfriend" I said.
"I'm his mission partner" Dorktown said.
"She's my one member fan club" I said.
"What do you two want?" Skelli asked.
"I need to borrow some money" I replied.
"You're the world's first postapocalyptic millionaire" Skelli said. "Why do you need to borrow money from me?"
"You're the world's second postapocalyptic millionaire. Who else am I gonna borrow it from?"
Skelli rolled her eyes.
"I spent everything I had turning The Gathering into Tomorrowland Weekend" I said. "Now it's gone."
"Not my problem" Skelli said.
"Yeah fuck Tomorrowland Weekend" Dorktown said.
"Why do you say that?" Skelli asked.
"There is no Tomorrowland."
"That's a relief" Skelli smirked. "I was beginning to think we were all just figments of John's imagination."
"What matters is Mohawk Asshole killed my pop" Dorktown said. "My pop was a friend of yours you called Messenger Kid."
"Mohawk Asshole... killed Messenger Kid?" Skelli asked.
Dorktown nodded.
"You're Messenger Kid's... kid?"
"Yeah. And we're going to kill Mohawk Asshole."
"She's going to kill Mohawk Asshole" I said.
"Why do you think Mohawk Asshole killed my pop?" Dorktown asked me.
I thought about it for a moment. I looked down at the table. I knew the answer before she said it.
"He was looking for you" she said.
I slowly looked up at Skelli.
"Dorktown is my mission partner. We're going to kill Mohawk Asshole."
"I owe Messenger Kid my life" Skelli said. "He saved my tits on more than one occasion. You've inherited my debt. What do you need?"
"Mohawk Asshole is going to Norwood" Dorktown continued. "We need money to get there. And weapons to capture him with."
"And money to reopen the Firebird factory" I added.
"I'll give you the money to get to Norwood" Skelli said to Dorktown. "You'll have to figure out weapons on your own."
"And the factory?" I asked.
"Chew on me bloody minge" Skelli replied.
"I thought you two were in love" Dorktown said.
Skelli grinned. "First you said you were gonna kill him. Then you said you were gonna capture him. Which is it?"
"First the second. Then the first. We capture him. We restrain him. Then we kill him as slowly as we can."
"Have you ever killed anyone?" Skelli asked.
"No but I've smashed the skulls of dead kangaroos. Can't be much different."
"It's different. Cracking skulls ain't all it's cracked up to be."
"You killed Fake Cop." Dorktown said. She was referring to Skelli's ex who was also Mohawk Asshole's best mate.
"I did it to save a life. Not out of revenge. When we returned to put petrol in the Firebird we buried Fake Cop's body. You can't let a crazy world make you go crazy too."
Skelli might never admit she said all that but I assure you she did.
"Why not?" Dorktown asked.
A man came to the table to ask if we were enjoying the food.
"Yes!" Dorktown exclaimed. "I love this place. Are you the owner? I wanna ask you something." She got up and walked with him to the cash register.
"Sweet kid" Skelli said.
"She's a psychopath" I replied.
Dorktown pointed at a beautiful vintage crossbow hanging on the wall and exchanged a few words with the shop owner. The owner took down the crossbow and handed it to her. She admired it for a moment. She said a few more words and smiled. He reached under the counter and handed her a single arrow. She returned to the table with the crossbow and arrow.
"I thought she didn't have any money" Skelli said.
I chuckled. "She doesn't."
Dorktown showed off her new toy. "We'll use this to capture him."
Then she looked at the table and grinned. She grabbed a butterknife. "And we'll use this... to kill him."
We left the diner. Skelli discreetly handed off a sack of coins to Dorktown. They exchanged a few words I couldn't hear then Skelli skedattled.
Firebird forgot to mention Skelli gave him a kiss goodbye. They're in love!!
Goddammit Dorktown. If you're gonna chime in at least give us some useful information. What did Skelli whisper to you?
She said "If you fuck him I'll smash your pretty little toes with a hammer."
Skelli definitely did not say that.
Me and Dorktown got into the Pinto.
"Norwood?" she asked.
"Van Nuys."CHAPTER 03: VAN NUYS

Not many people have written books in the past 38 years. Every book that gets written nowadays kinda has to be a history book and a philosophy book and a survival book too. So I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't tell you what I know about how things got to be the way they are and maybe offer some ideas I have about how to get things back to the way they were.
Are you gonna start rambling about economics again or are we gonna go kill this bloke?
Everything is economics. Every damn decision every one of us makes. So it's important. Stop fucking up my book.
I'm (we're) writing this book in what we call the Year 38. The reason we call it Year 38 is cuz the Big Bang happened 38 years ago. That was Year Zero.
The world used to be a much swankier place. I'm a prewar so I should know. I was there. Mohawk Asshole was there too. But he enjoyed the war. He relished it. For all I know he started it. Skelli and Dorktown were postwars.
The Big Bang wasn't just a war. There were diseases and pestilences and natural disasters and unnatural disasters too. By the time it was over the governments of the world had all bombed themselves out of existence and something like 95% of humanity was gone too.
Imagine you're one of the survivors. Imagine you work in a factory building cars. If you showed up for work and 95% of your coworkers were gone could you keep building cars? No way. That's why no one's built a new car in 38 years.
But now imagine you work on cars in your garage. Imagine you need an alternator. For every car that has an owner there are now 19 cars sitting around that don't.
Why steal when you can scavenge? Why fight when you can cooperate?
Now you're beginning to understand how some of us managed to keep the world spinning despite the assholes' best efforts to stop it.
The Big Bang didn't take away everything. It took away everything it could take. It couldn't take away our grit or guff or gumption or good old-fashioned American ingenuity. Yeah people were ingenious all over the world but back in the days before the Big Bang America was the best place to be ingenious. The USA was the most prosperous country in history.
The human brain has a thing called negativity bias. We focus on the bad stuff to ensure that threats don't get the better of us. So it was easy for people like Howard Zinn to catalog all the things that the USA got wrong. Yeah I read that book and yeah I get it. But the problem with negativity bias is that it makes us take the good stuff for granted. Why worry about the stuff that's hunky dory?
What's not so easy is figuring out what exactly it was that the USA got right. If I was gonna put the world back together I had to make sure it got put back together right.
Sure Tomorrowland Weekend was fake. But I was really trying to rebuild the world. I was gonna give people the real thing. The real Tomorrowland. The computers I was selling were only the beginning. One day those computers were gonna fit in your pocket. We'd have skyscrapers with working elevators. Jets and satellites in the skies. Missions to the moon and then we'd head for Mars. Muscle cars that make more power and drink less petrol.
It was only a matter of time plus the ingenuity of clever cunts like me. Inventing shit. Improving shit. Making money by earning it. Not stealing it. The only way we'd get to Tomorrowland was if we built it ourselves.
You probably think I'm a moneygrubbing monster who would have gone after that astronaut who grabbed my Six Million Dollar Man lunchbox if only Dorktown had been a bloke and not a sheila. You can think that if you want.
But I will not let you think for a moment that I don't have dreams. I will not let you think for a moment that I don't care about the greater good. My entire life has been devoted to rebuilding the world. Who says you have to suffer and sacrifice? If I can save the world and have a good time doing it then that's all the better. And maybe I'll even make some money along the way.
When I invented the Firebuddy I created new worldwide communication channels and brought back TV and movies and made money digital. Now I was gonna bring back cars. Shiny fucking Trans Ams with big fucking birds painted on the hoods. Don't even try to act like you don't want one.

"Van Nuys? What the fuck?" Dorktown asked. "We have to get to Norwood."
"Pontiac Firebirds were assembled in two locations" I said. "Norwood Ohio and Van Nuys California. Van Nuys is only an hour away. If Mohawk Asshole has half a brain he'll be headed there first."
"How much of a brain does he have?"
"He's not as dumb as he looks and sounds and thinks and acts."
Dorktown got out her book again and started flipping through it.
"What are you doing?"
"If we've got an hour then I've got questions."
I sighed. "Ok."
"Did Skelli know all along that Tomorrowland wasn't real?"
"She never even heard of Tomorrowland until my book came out last year."
"What about the scene where she witnessed you swapping timelines with John?"
I shrugged. "I made it up."
She laughed. "You're an asshole."
"I'm a storyteller."
"No you're not. I know for a fact that half your book is true. I just don't know which half. How did you survive your encounter with the grieving woman who wanted revenge?"
"I grabbed her gun and shot her with it."
"Did you ever really find out what was on the movie film in your parents' safe?"
"We gotta get some petrol." I pulled off toward an old servo that looked like it might still be in business.
"No wait! Did you know where Deadline was the whole time?"
I winked at Dorktown. Then I got out of the car and went in to look for signs of life.
