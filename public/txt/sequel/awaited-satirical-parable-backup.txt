CHAPTER 00.

The old sign came down as the new one went up. The old sign read "The Gathering." The new sign read "Tomorrowland Weekend."
"Tomorrowland Weekend! Tomorrowland Weekend! Where the Big Bang never happened!" Carnival barking isn't my style so I paid some motherfucker to shout for me. He was a little too good at his job. My ears hurt. "You are awaited at Tomorrowland Weekend!"
The Gathering used to be this free event in the California desert where lost souls came from all over the world to meet up with friends or family or whatever. But this year I'd bought out the whole damn thing and jazzed it up to look like a nonapocalyptic parallel universe I called Tomorrowland.
"Tomorrowland Weekend!" Barker barked. "Where the shoes have shoelaces. Where the cars have guzzoline. Where the streets are paved with asphalt!"
Hundreds of motherfuckers were lined up at the gate and I was the gatekeeper. To get into Tomorrowland Weekend you had to.... well I'll let Barker explain it.
"Costumes required for entry!" he screamed. I stuck my fingers in my ears. "Your Firebuddy is your ticket. If you do not have a Firebuddy you can buy one at the door."
The Firebuddy was a computer I'd invented. It was Firebuddy sales that had paid for this whole damn festival. Costumes were required because when you came to Tomorrowland Weekend you were supposed to feel like you'd really entered a parallel universe where the bombs had never fallen.
At the front of the line stood an impeccably-dressed man. Suit and tie and hat and everything. It was Year 38 now so I was damn sure it had been 38 years since I'd seen a bloke dressed up that nice. I remembered being a kid seeing my dad off to work and he'd be dressed like that.
"What are you supposed to be?" I asked.
"I'm an insurance salesman! Hi. How are ya. Nice weather huh? Can I interest you in a policy of insurance?" He handed me his business card.
"Nailing it! Where'd you get the suit?"
"Found it in a bunker."
"Far out." I said. He showed me his Firebuddy and I waved him in. "The briefcase is a nice touch."
Next guy had on a red hat and a yellow coat. He carried an axe. He offered me a metal bucket full of coins but I stopped him.
"Nice fireman gettup. That axe is in great shape mate."
"Yeah well the head's a little loose."
He handed it to me so I could take a closer look. "Looks all right." I said. "Wanna keep your shrapnel and barter me this instead?"
He took me up on the deal. He gave me the axe and his business card. I handed him a Firebuddy.
A woman in a homemade blue uniform was next.
"What are you?" I asked.
"I'm a police officer!" she said enthusiastically. "Have you done any crimes?"
"Crimes against humanity!" I replied.
"Remain silent!" she chuckled.
She handed me an ancient twenty dollar bill pressed between two sheets of clear plastic with a shitty wooden frame around it. Ugh.
"You don't have coins?" I asked.
"This is all I've got."
"You're gonna have to take it out of there. And you're not getting change." Nowadays most people were using Firebucks which was a computerized currency. But to use Firebucks you had to have a Firebuddy or some other kind of computer like a DingoDongle or an Assholebuddy. Nice part was over time the computer could generate new Firebucks using nothing but electricity and maths. In a year or two your computer would pay for itself. Now you get why so many people were standing in line.
The police officer put the frame on the ground and borrowed my axe to break it open. She handed me the bill. The thing was dirty and disintegrating but looked legit. I handed her a Firebuddy.
She started walking away but stopped and turned back. "Almost forgot" she said. "My business card." She handed it to me.
I had a little table set up with two of my childhood lunchboxes on it. The business cards went into my Pac Man lunchbox. The money went into my Six Million Dollar Man lunchbox. Both were overflowing. I was gonna need more lunchboxes.
One bloke was dressed as a construction worker. Another one was a race car driver. There was a politician. A deep sea diver. A doctor. An astronaut. The prewars were living out their stolen childhood dreams. The postwars were dreaming of a world they'd never known.
"Are you Firebird?" a teenage girl asked. She had an Australian accent.
"Used to be" I said. "Now I drive a 77 Ford Pinto. Might have to be known as Pinto from now on. What are you supposed to be? A homeless orphan? You can't wear that here. It breaks immersion."
"Will you sign my book?" she asked. She handed me a copy of a book I'd written a little while back:

AWAITED: NONFICTIONAL DELUSION

"Make it out to Torkdown."
"Dorktown?"
"Torkdown."
"To... Dorktown...." I scribbled my name.
"How can I get to Tomorrowland?" she asked.
"Buy a Firebuddy like everybody else" I told her.
"Not Tomorrowland Weekend" the girl said. "The real Tomorrowland. Like in your book."
A lot of people had read that book and taken it a bit too seriously. A lot of people had gotten it into their heads that Tomorrowland was a real place you could visit. That's what gave me the idea for Tomorrowland Weekend. Tomorrowland Weekend wouldn't just be a party in the desert. It would be a lifestyle. An identity. A culture. A family. We were no longer merely attendees of the Gathering or Tomorrowland Weekend. We were tomorrowlanders. We were gonna rebuild the world and this time we were gonna do it right. But it was gonna take work. Some of these lazy fucks thought they could jump out of this world and into a better one just by changing their clothes. And this girl hadn't even bothered to do that.
"You gotta buy a Firebuddy." I told her. I was really trying to emphasize that part. "You gotta dress up. Then I let you in. While you're in there maybe... MAYBE you swap timelines with another version of yourself and you teleport into the real Tomorrowland. Maybe not. Maybe you just buy a computer and go home. Now you're holding up the line. You buying a Firebuddy or what?"
"I don't have any money" she said.
"Ulfsbane!" I shouted.
My security guard appeared and grabbed the problem child.
"Take her to the highway and let her hitchhike back to Australia."
At that moment a skirmish broke out in the line and Ulfsbane let the girl run off. Me and Ulfsbane and a heap of other motherfuckers surrounded the assholes who were fighting.
The race car driver and the politician had knives in their hands and they had the construction worker on the ground. They'd already cut him up good and they were about to finish the job.
"Show us what he looks like on the inside!" someone cried.
But then Barker shouted the rule of The Gathering. "No fighting at The Gathering except for in The Cage!"
The fighting paused and all eyes turned to me. I hated having to make decisions like this but I put on my best authoritative badass face.
"It's Tomorrowland Weekend" I said. "But the rule still holds."
"You don't get it" the race car driver explained. "He's a Helly."
Someone shouted "Kill all Hellies."
I turned to Ulfsbane. "What's a Helly?" But talking to Ulfsbane was pretty much like talking to a wall. He grunted.
The politician added "And we're not inside The Gathering." He pointed to an orange ribbon I'd nailed to the ground a few feet away for the purpose of resolving arguments like this.
"He's right" someone said. The crowd was turning against me.
I had to think fast if I didn't want a dead body stinking up the line. I went over to the ribbon on the ground and pulled it up and away from the entrance gate. I unspooled some more and walked it around the fighting fuckers and back to the gate. I put a couple new nails into the ground to hold the ribbon in its new position.
"Welcome to Tomorrowland Weekend" I said to the three of them.
"See you in The Cage Helly" the race car driver said to the bleeding construction worker. He and the politician threw their money at me and grabbed Firebuddies from the stack. Then they both went digging in their pockets and pulled out business cards so they could ceremonially throw them at me too.
The construction worker got up and showed me his Firebuddy. "Glad to have you with us." he said. "It may not look like it right now but I assure you you're on the winning side of history."
"I'm not on any side of history" I replied.
He laughed. "Then you're part of the problem. That's the one thing Hellies and Gillies can agree on."
He handed me his business card. "President of the Hellies. Bart Chokula. Death to Gillies" it read.
"What's a Gilly?" I asked Ulfsbane.
Predictably enough Ulfsbane grunted.
The construction worker walked away.
The woman who was dressed as a doctor was next in line.
"I think that man needs medical attention" I said.
Her eyes narrowed over her surgical mask. "By letting that man into this event you've sent a message loud and clear that you don't even see people like me as human."
"What kind of person are you?" I asked.
"I... am a Gilly!" she hissed.
