CHAPTER 00: tomorrowland

The old sign came down as the new one went up. The old sign read "The Gathering." The new sign read "Tomorrowland Weekend."
"Tomorrowland Weekend! Where the Big Bang never happened!" Carnival barking isn't my style so I paid some motherfucker to shout for me. I called him Johnny Olson after that bloke who used to shout "A new car!" on The Price Is Right. "You are awaited at Tomorrowland Weekend!"
The Gathering used to be this free event in the California desert where lost souls came from all over the world to meet up with family and friends or whatever. But this year I'd bought out the whole damn thing and jazzed it up to look like a nonapocalyptic parallel universe I called Tomorrowland.
"Tomorrowland Weekend!" Johnny Olson barked. "Where there is no suffering! No hunger! No war! No politics! Nothing to fight over. All the shoes have shoelaces. All the cars have guzzoline. The streets are paved with asphalt!"
Hundreds of motherfuckers were lined up at the gate and I was the gatekeeper. To get into Tomorrowland Weekend you had to.... well I'll let Johnny explain it.
"Costumes and Firebuddy required for entry!" he screamed. "If you do not have a Firebuddy you can buy one at the door."
The Firebuddy was a "laptop" computer I'd invented. I called it a laptop cuz it was small enough to fit on your lap. It was Firebuddy sales that had paid for this whole damn festival. Costumes were required so that when you came to Tomorrowland Weekend you'd feel like you'd really entered a parallel universe where the bombs had never fallen. People built fake little office buildings or flower shops or libraries or whatever and pretended that life was beautiful and boring.
At the front of the line stood an impeccably-dressed man. Suit and tie and hat and everything. It was Year 38 now so I was damn sure it had been 38 years since I'd seen a bloke dressed up that nice. I remembered being a kid seeing my dad off to work and he'd be dressed like that.
"What are you supposed to be?" I asked.
"I'm an insurance salesman! Hi. How are ya. How are the wife and kids? Can I interest you in a policy of insurance?" He handed me his business card.
"Nailing it. Where'd you get the suit?"
"Found it in a bunker."
"Far out." I said. He showed me his Firebuddy and I waved him in. "The briefcase is a nice touch."
Next guy had on a red hat and a yellow coat. He carried an axe. He offered me a metal bucket full of coins but I stopped him.
"Nice fireman gettup. That axe is in great shape mate."
"The head's a little loose."
He handed it to me so I could take a closer look. "Looks all right." I said. "Wanna keep your shrapnel and barter me this instead?"
He took me up on the deal. He gave me the axe and his business card. I handed him a Firebuddy.
A woman in a homemade blue uniform was next.
"What are you?" I asked.
"I'm a police officer!" she said enthusiastically. "Have you done any crimes?"
"Crimes against humanity!" I replied.
"Remain silent!" she chuckled.
She handed me a framed twenty dollar bill pressed between two sheets of plexiglass. Ugh.
"You don't have coins?" I asked.
"This is all I've got."
"You're gonna have to take it out of there. And you're not getting change." Nowadays most people were using Firebucks which was a computerized currency I'd come up with. But to use Firebucks you had to have a Firebuddy or some other kind of computer like a DingoDongle or an Assholebuddy. Nice part was over time the computer could make more Firebucks using nothing but electricity and maths. In a year or two your computer would pay for itself. Now you get why so many people were standing in line.
The police officer put the frame on the ground and borrowed my axe to break it open. She handed the axe back to me. "Head's a little loose" she said.
She carefully pulled the sheets of plastic apart and handed me the bill. I handed her a Firebuddy.
She started walking away but stopped and turned back. "Almost forgot" she said. "Here's my business card."
I had a little table set up with two of my childhood lunchboxes on it. The business cards went into my Pac Man lunchbox. The money went into my Six Million Dollar Man lunchbox. Both of them were overflowing.
One bloke was dressed as a construction worker. Another was a race car driver. There was a movie star. A doctor. There was even someone dressed up as a thief but he just reminded me of the Hamburglar. The prewars were living out their stolen childhood dreams. The postwars were dreaming of a world they'd never known.
"Are you Firebird?" a teenage girl asked. She had an Australian accent.
"Used to be" I said. "That car was smashed to bits. Now I drive a 77 Ford Pinto. Might have to be known as Pinto from now on. What are you supposed to be? A homeless orphan? You can't wear that here. It breaks immersion."
"Will you sign my book?" she asked. She handed me a copy of a book I'd finished last year:

AWAITED: NONFICTIONAL DELUSION

"Make it out to Torkdown."
"Dorktown?"
"Torkdown."
"To... Dorktown...." I scribbled my name.
"How can I get to Tomorrowland?" she asked.
"Buy a Firebuddy like everyone else" I told her.
"Not Tomorrowland Weekend" the girl said. "The real Tomorrowland. Like in your book."
A lot of people had read that book and taken it a bit too seriously. A lot of people had gotten it into their heads that Tomorrowland was a real place you could visit. That's what gave me the idea for Tomorrowland Weekend. Tomorrowland Weekend wouldn't just be a party in the desert. It would be a chance to live in the world of my book. It would be a lifestyle. An identity. A culture. A family. We were no longer merely attendees of the Gathering or Tomorrowland Weekend. We were tomorrowlanders. We were gonna rebuild the world and this time we were gonna do it right. But it was gonna take work. Some of these lazy fucks thought they could jump out of this world and into a better one just by changing their clothes. And this girl hadn't even bothered to do that.
"You gotta buy a Firebuddy." I told her. I was really trying to emphasize that part. "You gotta dress up. Then I let you in. While you're in there maybe... maybe you swap timelines with another version of yourself and you teleport into the real Tomorrowland. Maybe not. Maybe you just buy a computer and go home. Now you're holding up the line. You buying a Firebuddy or what?"
"I don't have any money" she said.
"Ulfsbane!" I shouted.
My hired hunk appeared and grabbed the problem child.
"Take her to the highway and let her hitchhike back to Australia."
At that moment a skirmish broke out in line and Ulfsbane let the girl run off. Me and Ulfsbane and a heap of other motherfuckers surrounded the assholes who were fighting.
The race car driver and the movie star had knives in their hands and they had the construction worker on the ground. He was unarmed. They'd already cut him up good and they were about to finish the job.
"Show us what he looks like on the inside!" somebody shouted.
But then some other bloke shouted "No fighting at The Gathering except for in The Cage!"
The fighting paused and all eyes turned to me. I hated making decisions like this but I put on my best authoritative badass face.
"There ain't no laws anymore but that don't mean there ain't no rules" I said. "It's not The Gathering anymore. It's Tomorrowland Weekend. But the rule still holds."
"You don't get it" the race car driver explained. "He's a Helly."
Someone shouted "Kill all Hellies."
I turned to Ulfsbane. "What's a Helly?"
Talking to Ulfsbane was pretty much like talking to a hole in the ground. He grunted.
The movie star added "And we're not inside The Gathering yet." She pointed to some orange tape I'd nailed to the ground beneath the sign.
I had to think fast if I didn't want a dead body stinking up the line. I went over to the tape on the ground and pulled it up and away from the entrance gate. I unspooled some more and walked it around the fighting fuckers and back to the gate. I put a couple new nails into the ground to hold the tape in its new position.
"Welcome to Tomorrowland Weekend" I said to the three of them.
"See you in The Cage Helly" the race car driver said to the construction worker.
The movie star showed me her Firebuddy and threw a card on my table.
The race car driver handed me his money and grabbed a Firebuddy from the stack. He gave me a card that read "Dr. Freaky Freedoms PhD. President Of The Gillies. Kill All Hellies."
"What's a Gilly?" I asked Ulfsbane.
Ulfsbane grunted.
The construction worker got up and showed me his Firebuddy. "You did the right thing" he said. "You're on the winning side of history."
"I'm not on any side of history" I replied.
He handed me his card. It had blood on it. It read "Count Bartholomu Bubury. President Of The Hellies. Death to Gillies."
He went in. The doctor was next in line.
"That man needs medical attention" I said.
Her eyes narrowed over her surgical mask. "When you saved that man's life you sent a message loud and clear that you want to erase the existence of people like me."
"What kind of a person are you?" I asked.
"You should ask yourself that question" she hissed.

Hundreds of people stood outside The Cage screaming and cheering and banging on the fence and I was standing in the center of it all.
"Welcome to the first ever Tomorrowland Weekend!" I shouted into the microphone.
The crowd went wild. They wanted blood. I gestured for everyone to quiet down and then I continued speaking.
"People have come from all over the world to be here tonight. Some of us are here to find thems we're looking for and thems we've lost. Some of us are here to make money. Some of us are here to have a good time. But all of us are here because we want to build a better tomorrow!" I paused for a big cheer but it wasn't as big as I'd hoped.
"Death to Gillies!" someone shouted.
"Kill all Hellies!" someone retorted.
An empty bottle flew at me from a random direction and shattered at my feet.
"Death comes soon enough!" I said. "It doesn't matter if you're a Helly or a Gilly. What matters is that we are all tomorrowlanders!"
This was clearly not what they wanted to hear. It was time to give them what they wanted.
"Is it possible to retain your humanity in a world gone mad? Dollars to wingnuts every one of us here tonight has killed at some point in our lives. Ever since the first great Gathering 38 years ago there have been Cage matches to resolve conflicts like this. Tonight Tomorrowland Weekend continues this tradition!"
Now the crowd was getting worked up. A little too much maybe. The whole Cage was shaking.
"Death to Gillies!" half of them shouted.
"Kill all Hellies!" half of them replied.
"And tonight's Cage match is not just any Cage match. It's the most significant Cage match of the modern era! In this corner we have Count Bartholomu Bubury. President Of The Hellies!"
Half the crowd cheered.
"And in this corner we have Dr. Freaky Freedoms PhD. President Of The Gillies!"
The other half cheered.
I handed swords to both of them. "Let the battle begin!"
The crowd went mad and I got the hell out of there. I handed the microphone to Johnny on the way out.
"You're not gonna stay and watch? This one's gonna be good" he said.
I shook my head.
I went back to my trailer and fired up my Firebuddy. The Firebuddy would automatically connect to other nearby computers and let you communicate with them. When you bought a Firebuddy it came with free access to a "social networking website" I'd built called You Are Awaited.
The messages people posted on You Are Awaited used to be hopeful and friendly and positive. But lately things were different. People had started posting things like "If you're a Gilly we can't be friends" and "Hellies should be lined up and shot." I scrolled through the messages. There was no end to the vitriol.
My algorithm had noticed that people wanted to talk about this stuff so it had encouraged them.  But rather than sparking reasoned debate the algorithm had radicalized both sides and no one was listening to each other. There was even talk of civil war.
What had I done?CHAPTER 01: dorktown

There was a knock at the door. I opened it. It was Dorktown.
"You again? Ulfsbane!" I shouted.
"No wait" she said. "I have a Firebuddy now. Ulfsbane let me in." She showed me her new laptop.
"I thought you didn't have any money."
"I don't."
"How'd you get a Firebuddy?"
"Somebody gave me one."
"You still look like a ragamuffin."
"What are you supposed to be? What's with the cowboy hat and leather jacket?"
"I'm a software engineer named John Binns who's attending a postapocalyptic festival called Wasteland Weekend."
She giggled.
"Why are you here?" I asked.
"I need to talk to you about Tomorrowland. But first I have a surprise."
"I hate surprises. Just tell me what it is."
"A friend of yours is here to see you."
"I don't have any friends."
"Yes you do. You wrote about him in your book. Ulfsbane won't let him in even though he has a Firebuddy."
I thought about everyone I'd written about in my book. Dorktown was from Australia. I was only friends with one bloke out there. Could it be... Messenger Kid?
"All right let's go."
When we stepped outside I looked over at The Cage. Some people had climbed up the sides and onto the top. The entire structure was rocking back and forth. The crowd hooted and hollered like a pack of hungry animals. Maybe tonight this Hellies and Gillies stuff would be decided once and for all and I'd never have to hear about it again.
We headed away from The Cage toward the Tomorrowland Weekend entrance gate. The light was broken and Ulfsbane was messing with the bulb. All I could see was the silhouette of a man who was definitely not Messenger Kid.
We were just a few feet away when the light suddenly flickered on and lit up his face.
"G'day mate!" said a maniacal grinning mohawked head wearing a goddamn tuxedo.
I leaped back in terror and fell to the ground. "Jesus fucking christ" I said. Did I mention he was wearing a tuxedo?
Dorktown giggled. "I found Bruce!" she said.
Yeah his real name was Bruce but I referred to him as Mohawk Asshole. The name is kinda dumb but I gave it to him when I was ten so what can I say. He got his first name cuz he had a mohawk. He got his last name cuz he killed my family.
And if you're wondering how I got the name Firebird it's cuz I stole Mohawk Asshole's Firebird Trans Am on the day he killed my family and drove it around for a few decades.
I got up and pulled out my FP45 Liberator. I twisted the cocking knob into place and stuck it in Mohawk Asshole's face. It was a crap gun and it only held one shot but one shot was all I'd need.
"No fighting at The Gathering except for in The Cage" he said calmly.
Dorktown grabbed my arm and pulled it down. "Why would you shoot Bruce?" she asked. "Aren't you two best mates now?" She got out her book and started flipping through the pages.
I was beginning to tire of people treating my book like it was an oracle of truth just because it had the word "nonfictional" in the title. But it was people taking my book seriously that had made this whole festival possible. And Dorktown was technically right. At the end of that book I refrained from killing Mohawk Asshole because we'd become friends in a very roundabout way.
I put the gun away. "It's Tomorrowland Weekend" I said. "And you're not allowed in."
"I'm already in" he said. He pointed at the tape on the ground that I'd relocated earlier that day. Ok he had a point.
"Dammit Ulfsbane" I said.
Ulfsbane looked at the tape and made a confused grunt.
"We're going back to my trailer to catch up. Don't let in any more psychotic killers."
"There goes all your customers" Dorktown said.
We headed back to my trailer.
"Don't you want his autograph too?" I asked Dorktown.
"Already got it" Dorktown replied.
I looked at Mohawk Asshole's outfit. "What are you supposed to be anyway?"
"I'm a millionaire attending a fundraiser to re-elect Ronald Reagan."
I sat the two of them down in my trailer and shut the door.
"What the fuck do you want?" I asked.
They both started blabbering.
"You first" I said pointing at Mohawk Asshole.
"Thought I'd pay you a visit. Have a cuppa tea."
"I appreciate the buddy buddy act" I told him. "But we both know it's an act."
"All right then" he said. "Give me my car back and I won't tell anyone your secret."
Dorktown looked at me. "What's your secret?"
I ignored her. I reached into my jacket pocket and took out the old Firebird's VIN plate. I tossed it to Mohawk Asshole. "That's all that's left of the car."
He looked at the VIN plate and started reading aloud. But he wasn't reading the letters and numbers. He remembered what the letters and numbers meant. He was decoding them. He'd loved that car as much as I had. "Pontiac... Trans Am... 2 door coupe... 455 cubic inch 4 barrel V8... 1975...." He paused and looked up before translating the last letter. We both knew it by heart. It was the letter N.
"They ain't never gonna make another car like that again" I said.
"Why not?" Dorktown asked. "Why not make a new Firebird?"
I looked at Dorktown. I looked at Mohawk Asshole.
"Norwood" he said. He got up so fast he knocked over his chair. He ran out the door and started yelling at whoever would listen and also at whoever would not listen.
"There is no Tomorrowland!" he shouted. "Firebird's book is a heap of lies! Nobody can swap timelines!"
"That's the secret?" Dorktown asked. "Nobody can swap timelines?"
At this point I should probably clarify that the reason tomorrowlanders all believed they could come to this event and teleport into an alternate universe known as Tomorrowland did indeed have something to do with that book I wrote.
In the book I claimed it was possible for people to swap places with doppelganger versions of themselves in Tomorrowland. I claimed I'd visited a nonapocalyptic Tomorrowland on multiple occasions by trading places with another version of me I called John. I claimed Mohawk Asshole had vanished into Tomorrowland and left in his place a Mr. Rogers version of himself I called Bruce.
It was all just advertising. I was selling futuristic computers. I never expected anyone would actually believe the computers came from the future.
"Nobody can swap timelines" I said.
"So that was... Mohawk Asshole? Not Bruce?"
"Correct."
Dorktown stood up. "Tomorrowland doesn't exist?"
"It exists in our hearts."
"I came all the way around the world for this."
"Tomorrowland is the friends you made along the way."
"Fuck you" she said. "I can kill him with or without you."
She stormed out.
I followed her out the door and grabbed her by the arm.
"Kill who?" I asked.
A rising tide of crowd noises emanated from the direction of The Cage. I turned to look. It was covered top to bottom with people and the entire structure was leaning to one side.
"I'd tell you if you'd listen to me for one second" Dorktown said.
I turned and looked her in the eye. "Why are you here Dorktown?"
"My name is Torkdown." She held my gaze with fire in her eyes. "And I'm here to kill Mohawk Asshole."
"Why?"
"He killed my pop."
"Who was your pop?"
"You used to call him Messenger Kid."
Just then there was a loud crack and a massive ground shaking thud followed by terrified screams. The Cage had collapsed. I felt the heat of an explosion behind me and Dorktown's face lit up orange.
Neither of us turned.
Neither of us blinked.
Now let me explain who the fuck is Messenger Kid. I refuse to write a flashback because I fucking hate flashbacks. Time moves forward in a linear fashion. I ain't saying I'm happy about that. Especially when it comes to Messenger Kid. But if that's how time moves then stories should damn well move that way too. So I'm just gonna tell it how I remember it.
Back when the world went to shit I found myself stuck in Australia. I only had two friends there. Mad Skelli who you'll meet later and Messenger Kid. Messenger Kid was mute but like they say actions speak louder than words. You'll just have to imagine the hijinks and shenanigans we got into. Or read the damn book. Anyway Messenger Kid was the kind of friend who'd risk everything for you and he wouldn't think nothing of it. He saved my ass on more than one occasion. I owed him my life.
"You came here for my help?" I asked.
"I thought we had to get Bruce to swap timelines with Mohawk Asshole in Tomorrowland to bring back the real Mohawk Asshole. But now you're telling me that Bruce is the real Mohawk Asshole. So now I'm gonna go kill Bruce. With or without you."
"James Bond once said 'Before setting out on revenge you first dig two graves.'"
"I'll dig as many graves as it takes" she said. "Are you gonna help me or not?"
"I had a chance to kill him once you know."
"Page 129. Why didn't you?"
I couldn't think of any more cool James Bond quotes so I let her go. She whipped her head around and vanished into the darkness.
I ran back to my trailer to grab my axe and then I headed for The Cage.
What used to be The Cage. It was now a heap of wood and metal and flames. I found Johnny and asked him what was up.
As always he shouted enthusiastically. "The Helly killed the Gilly president. The Gillies went berserk and the whole thing collapsed to the ground. Everyone started fighting. I think we just started a civil war."
Then Johnny ran off like he knew something I didn't. I turned around to discover that closing in on my left and right were two gangs of monsters dressed as squares. There were secretaries with torches and farmers with pitchforks and yodelers with nunchucks. The burning Cage was behind me so going backward was not an option.
The Hamburglar led the group on the left. The police officer led the group on the right.
It was late but even the sleeping tomorrowlanders heard the ruckus and peeked out of their camps to find out what was going on. Hundreds of them woke up and joined the mob.
"Part of the solution!" one side chanted while pointing at themselves.
"Part of the problem!" they chanted while pointing at the others.
The other side had a chant of its own. "With us!" they shouted while pointing at themselves.
"Against us!" they shouted while pointing at the others.
I tightened my grip on the axe and took off running through this nightmare gauntlet.
The two fronts went to war and I was stuck in the middle. I got down on my hands and knees and crawled through the foolishness.
"Part of the solution!"
"Part of the problem!"
"Neither. Both. Pardon me. Coming through" I said. A severed hand landed on the ground in front of me.
"With us!"
"Against us!"
"Both. Neither. Excuse me. Sorry" I said.
Once I was through I stood up and ran.
Someone shouted "There he is! The guy who saved the Helly president! Get him!"
I ran for my trailer but when I got there it was up in flames. The fireman was lobbing molotovs. My entire inventory of Firebuddies was destroyed along with the one that I used every day.
Ok so that goal was stuffed. My next goal was to get to my car and get the hell out of here.
I ran around back and hopped into my Pinto Cruising Wagon. 171 cubic inch V6. Original paint. Silver with yellow and orange and purple stripes. The thing looked like sex on wheels but drove like a moose on rollerskates. There wasn't a single dent on it cuz they were famous for exploding on impact. No one had the courage to smash into it. Maybe it was all just media hype but it kept the assholes at bay.
I tried to get it started. I say tried cuz this car was no Firebird. It had one third the torque. One third the horsepower. And it took three times as long to get started.
The angry tomorrowlanders heard me cranking the Pinto and came running around back.
An astronaut was using their helmet to headbutt the side glass. The bloke who'd tried to sell me an insurance policy climbed onto the bonnet and banged his briefcase on the windscreen. The fireman lobbed a molotov at the Pinto and set the insurance guy on fire. Fortunately the Pinto did not explode.
The engine finally turned over on its own power. I floored it and managed to shake off the flaming insurance guy. His briefcase flew open and papers went everywhere.
Pissed off tomorrowlanders were running in every direction. I was headed for the main gate. My brand new Tomorrowland Weekend sign was on fire. A group of Girl Scouts was rocking the scaffolding back and forth trying to pull it down.
The movie star was arguing with Ulfsbane at the gate. While Ulfsbane was distracted a scary looking deep sea diver in one of those hard shelled diving suits grabbed the Six Million Dollar Man lunchbox with my money in it and hobbled away. Ulfsbane noticed and went after him but the movie star tripped him and he went down.
As I neared the gate the scaffolding finally tipped. I gave it the bejeezus but the car bogged down. Yeah that damn car actually slowed down when you stepped on the throttle. I just could not get that carburetor adjusted right. I lifted up on the pedal and barely made it through the gate just in time to look in the mirror and see my beautiful new sign smash onto the ground. A few burning boards bounced off the roof but the Pinto still did not explode.
The first ever Tomorrowland Weekend would also be the last.
I stopped the car and got out. I'd put everything I had into this event. Now the whole thing was up in flames. Guess I should have bought that insurance policy.
I heard someone to my left kickstarting a motorbike. I heard someone to my right calling for help.
I looked to my left. The deep sea diver with my lunchbox full of coins was about to escape on a Honda CR250M Elsinore.
I looked to my right. Dorktown was trapped under the burning scaffolding that had just fallen.
I looked left again. I looked right again.
Goddammit.
The diver rode off as I chopped away at the scaffolding with my axe.CHAPTER 02: bakersfield

The next morning I borrowed Dorktown's Firebuddy to log in to You Are Awaited and send a message to someone who might help us.
He didn't just borrow it. He's writing this whole damn book on my Firebuddy. That means I can help write it!!
Stop it Dorktown.
We stopped at the Woolworth's diner in Bakersfield and ordered burgers and malts as screaming idiots ran around outside murdering each other and setting shit on fire.
"What are we sitting around for?" Dorktown asked. "Mohawk Asshole could be in Norwood by now."
"Do you know where Norwood is?" I asked.
Dorktown looked toward the entrance. "Oh my god! Is that her?"
She got up and ran to the door. "Are you Mad Skelli? Can I have your autograph?"
"Mind if I sit down first?" Skelli replied.
Skelli sat down and signed Dorktown's book.
"Isn't she a bit young for you?" Skelli asked.
"She's not my girlfriend" I said.
"I'm his mission partner" Dorktown said.
"She's the president of my one member fan club" I said.
"What do you want?" Skelli asked me.
"I need to borrow some money."
"You're the world's first postapocalyptic millionaire. Why do you need to borrow money from me?"
"You're the world's second postapocalyptic millionaire. Who else am I gonna borrow it from? I spent everything I had turning The Gathering into Tomorrowland Weekend and the assholes burned it down."
"Fuck Tomorrowland Weekend" Dorktown said. "There is no Tomorrowland. Firebird made it all up."
"That's a relief" Skelli said. "I was worried we were all just figments of John's imagination."
"What matters is Mohawk Asshole killed my pop" Dorktown said. "My pop was a friend of yours you called Messenger Kid."
Skelli looked at her and was silent for a moment. Then she said "Mohawk Asshole killed Messenger Kid? You're Messenger Kid's kid?"
"Yeah. And we're gonna kill Mohawk Asshole."
"She's gonna kill Mohawk Asshole" I said.
Dorktown turned to me. "Why do you think Mohawk Asshole killed my pop?"
I thought about it. Then I looked down at the table. I knew the answer.
"He was looking for you" Dorktown said.
When I'd gotten on a boat and returned to the USA thirteen years ago I'd left Skelli and Messenger Kid behind. They were the only ones who'd known where I'd gone.
I looked up at Skelli. "Dorktown is my mission partner" I said. "We're gonna kill Mohawk Asshole."
Skelli nodded and turned to Dorktown. "Your father saved my tits on more than one occasion. I owe him my life. You've inherited my debt. What do you need?"
"Mohawk Asshole is going to Norwood" Dorktown said. "We need money to get there and weapons to capture him with."
"And money to reopen the Firebird plant" I added.
"I'll give you the money to get to Norwood" Skelli said to Dorktown. "You'll have to figure out weapons on your own."
"And the assembly plant?" I asked.
"Chew on me bloody minge" Skelli replied.
"I thought you two were in love" Dorktown said.
Skelli turned to Dorktown. "First you said you were gonna kill him. Then you said you were gonna capture him. Which is it?"
"First the second. Then the first. We're gonna tie him up drop him out of a helicopter."
That was oddly specific and vaguely concerning.
"A helicopter?" I said.
Dorktown nodded.
"Do you have a helicopter?" Skelli asked.
"We'll have to borrow one" she said.
"Have you ever killed anyone?"
"I've smashed the skulls of dead kangaroos. Can't be much different."
"It's different."
"You killed Fake Cop." Dorktown was referring to Skelli's ex who was also Mohawk Asshole's best mate.
"I did it to save a life" Skelli said. "Not for revenge. When we went back to get the Firebird we buried his body. You can't let a crazy world make you go crazy too."
"Why not?" Dorktown asked.
A man came to the table and asked if we were enjoying the food.
"Yes!" Dorktown exclaimed. "Are you the owner? I wanna ask you something." She got up and walked with him to the cash register. She touched his arm and giggled.
"Sweet kid" Skelli said.
"She's a psychopath" I replied.
Dorktown pointed at a vintage Barnett Wildcat crossbow that was hanging on the wall. The shop owner took it down and handed it to her. She admired it for a moment. She said a few more words and smiled. The owner reached under the counter and handed her a single arrow and waved goodbye.
"I thought she didn't have any money" Skelli said.
I chuckled. "She doesn't."
We left the diner. Skelli used her DingoDongle to transfer some Firebucks to Dorktown and handed her a sack of coins just in case she needed cash. They exchanged a few words I couldn't hear. Then Skelli skedattled.
Firebird forgot to mention that Skelli gave him a kiss goodbye. They're in love!!
Goddammit Dorktown. If you're gonna chime in at least give us some useful information. What did Skelli whisper to you?
She said "If you fuck him I'll smash your pretty little toes with a hammer."
Skelli definitely did not say that.
Dorktown put her new crossbow in the back seat of the Pinto.
"Can I drive?" Dorktown asked.
"Nobody drives my car" I said as we got in.
"Norwood?" she asked.
"Van Nuys" I said.CHAPTER 03: VAN NUYS

Not many people have written books in the past 38 years. Nowadays every book that gets written has to be a history book and a philosophy book and a survival book too. So I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't tell you what I know about how things got to be the way they are and offer some ideas about how to get things back to how they ought to be.
I hope you're gonna spew on about economics again. That was my favourite part of the last book!!
You're being sarcastic aren't you. Listen. Economics is more than just the study of how people spend money. It's the study of how we make choices. The choices we make change our lives and the lives of those around us. The choices we make change the world. So economics is the study of how to change the world. Stop fucking up my (our!!) book.
I'm (we're!!) writing this book in what we call the Year 38. The reason we call it Year 38 is cuz the Big Bang happened 38 years ago. That was Year Zero.
The world used to be a much swankier place. I'm a prewar so I should know. I was there. Mohawk Asshole was there too. Skelli and Dorktown were postwars.
The Big Bang wasn't just a war. There were diseases and pests and disasters both natural and unnatural. By the time it was over the governments of the world had bombed themselves out of existence and taken 95% of humanity with them.
Imagine you're one of the survivors. Imagine you work in the Norwood assembly plant building Trans Ams. If you showed up for work and 95% of your coworkers were gone could you keep building cars? No way. That's why no one's built a new car in 38 years.
But now imagine you're working on your car in your garage. Imagine you need an alternator. For every car that has an owner there are now 19 cars sitting around that don't.
Why steal when you can scavenge? Why fight when you can cooperate? That's how some of us managed to keep the world spinning despite the assholes' best efforts.
The Big Bang took away everything it could take. But it couldn't take away our grit or guff or gumption or good old-fashioned American ingenuity. Yeah people are ingenious all over the world but back in the old days everyone came to America to be ingenious. The USA was the most prosperous country in history.
The human brain has a thing called negativity bias. We focus on the bad stuff to ensure that threats don't get the better of us. So it was easy for people like Howard Zinn to catalog all the things that the USA got wrong. Yeah I read that book and yeah I get it.
But Norman Borlaug saved a billion lives by inventing new strains of wheat and people still look for reasons to criticize him. Not me. I say if you save a billion lives you get a free pass to murder any ten people of your choice.
The problem with negativity bias is that it makes us take the good stuff for granted. So  when we look back on US history what's not so easy is figuring out what exactly it was that the USA got right. If I was gonna put the world back together I had to make sure I put it back together right.
Yeah Tomorrowland Weekend was fake. But I was really trying to rebuild the world. I was gonna give people the real Tomorrowland. The computers I was selling were only the beginning.
One day those computers are gonna fit in your pocket. We'll bring back skyscrapers and jets and satellites. Then we'll make space stations. Cities on the moon. Cities on Mars.
It's only a matter of time plus the ingenuity of clever cunts like me. Inventing shit. Improving shit. Making money by earning it. Not stealing it.
I may be a moneygrubbing capitalist pig but I will not let you think for a moment that I don't have dreams. I will not let you think for a moment that I don't care about the greater good. My entire life has been devoted to rebuilding the world. Who says you have to suffer and sacrifice to save the world? If I can save the world and make money doing it then that's all the better.
I invented the Firebuddy. I brought back TV and movies. I made money digital. Now I'm gonna bring back cars. Shiny fucking Trans Ams with big fucking birds painted on the bonnets. Don't even try to pretend like you don't want one.
I do want one!! Hot pink with a blue bird. But can we get back to the fighting and killing now??

"Van Nuys?" Dorktown asked. "What the fuck? We have to get to Norwood."
"Pontiac Firebirds were assembled in two locations" I said. "Norwood Ohio and Van Nuys California. Van Nuys is a suburb of Las Diablas. It's only two hours away. If Mohawk Asshole has half a brain he'll be headed there first."
"How much of a brain does he have?"
"He's not as dumb as he looks and sounds and thinks and acts."
"Do you know how to build a car?"
"I know what I don't know. And I know who to ask."
Dorktown got out her book again and started flipping through it.
"What are you doing?"
"If we've got an hour then I've got some more questions."
"Ok shoot."
"Did Skelli know all along that Tomorrowland wasn't real?"
"She never even heard of Tomorrowland until my book came out."
"What about that scene where she witnessed you swapping timelines with John?"
"I made it up."
She laughed. "You're an asshole."
"I'm a storyteller."
"No you're not. I know for a fact that half your book is true. I just don't know which half. Like at the end of the book you were held at gunpoint by the woman with the paperclip necklace who blamed you for her husband's death. She was gonna kill you. But you're still here. How did you escape?"
"I grabbed her gun and shot her."
"Did you ever really find out what was on the movie film in your parents' safe?"
I pulled off at an old servo in Castaic that looked like it might still be in business. The joint was called Gallion's Corner. "We gotta get some petrol."
"No wait! I'm not done! Did you know where Deadline was the whole time?"
I winked at her. Then I got out of the car and went in to look for signs of life.
He didn't really wink at me. He answered my question. But I'm not telling any of you fuckers what he said!!
Dorktown found my JVC RCM90 cassette player and Koss PRO4A headphones in the back seat and tried them out.
I found a bloke inside who had some petrol for sale. "Fill her up. She's paying" I said. "Where's the dunny?"
"Huh?"
"The restroom?"
"Around the side."
I headed around the building and tugged on the door. Locked.
"Just a minute" a muffled voice said.
I paced around for a moment before I noticed the front wheel and fender of a motorbike peeking around from behind the building. I could recognize that bike from a mile away. Honda CR250M Elsinore. It was the goddamn deep sea diver's bike.
The toilet flushed. Fuck.
I found an old rusty modular shelving unit and pushed it up against the restroom door.
"Dorktown!" I shouted.
No response.
"Dorktown!"
Nothing.
I ran around front while the diver struggled to push his way out of the restroom. Dorktown was still listening to music. I snatched the headphones off of her.
"What the fuck?" she asked.
"It's him!"
"Mohawk Asshole?" She got out and went for her crossbow.
"No. The asshole who stole my Six Million Dollar Man lunchbox!"
"Lunchbox? Jesus fuck. I'll buy you another lunch."
"No my lunchbox full of money!" I tried to grab her crossbow but she held on tight.
"You have a gun. Go shoot him with it."
He'd almost bashed his way out of the restroom. I ran back to the door and held it in place. I pulled out my Liberator and twisted the cocking knob into place. I pointed it into the doorway.
"Give me back my lunchbox you chum dumpster!" I yelled.
Wait that's a good one. This asshole just earned himself a nickname.
Chumdumpster braced himself against the opposite wall and kicked the door as hard as he could. The shelving unit fell over with me under it.
He pushed his way out of the restroom. He had my lunchbox in his hand. He climbed on top of the shelving unit and trapped me under it.
I couldn't breathe.
"Dorktown" I gasped.
I could see his face laughing through the thick glass of  his helmet.
"Help" I whispered.
I stuck my gun against his metal suit and pulled the trigger. The Liberator's spot welds all blew out and the gun cracked in half in my hand. I have no idea if the bullet actually left the chamber but if it did Chumdumpster sure as hell didn't notice.
He got up and tottered over to his bike. I could tell he wasn't wearing a fully functional waterproof suit because he had on motorbike gloves and motorbike boots. He put my lunchbox into his saddlebag and came back with a rope.
He tied one end of the rope to my foot. He tied the other end to his bike. He got on and started it up.
He pulled away slowly to tighten up the slack. He stopped and turned to look at me. Then he revved the engine and pulled away hard.
He yanked me out from under the shelves and dragged me across the bitumen. The bike turned onto the road and picked up speed.
I did my best to curl into a ball and sit up so I could get my hands on the rope around my foot. I couldn't untie it. The knot got tighter and tighter the further he dragged me. But I did manage to grab the rope and pull myself forward so the rope wasn't pulling on my leg so hard.
Then I positioned the edge of my foot on the top of the rope so the rope was being crushed between my foot and the road. The rope started smoking.
Finally the rope snapped. I slid into a ditch and Chumdumpster rode off.
I had blood all over me and my jeans were full of holes. I limped back to the servo.
Dorktown looked up and took off the headphones.
"How'd you do?" she asked.
"Why didn't you come after me?"
"You looked like you had it under control. And you told me never to drive your car" she said.
"New rule. You can drive my car if it's an emergency."
"Me drive Pinto! Me drive Pinto!"
"Only in an emergency. And there aren't going to be any more emergencies."
I got in the car and started it up. Then I remembered something. I turned to face her.
"If you do drive the car don't hit anything and don't get shot."
"Why not?"
"Pintos are famous for exploding. Ok?"
"Exploding car. Got it."
"What are you listening to?" I asked.
She grabbed the cassette box. It was a mixtape of bootlegs my dad had made for me when I was a kid. "The Rolling Stones" she said. "Shattered. Live in Fort Worth 1978."
"I heard a rumor Keith Richards survived the Big Bang and he's still alive today."
"Who's Keith Richards?"

When we arrived in Van Nuys we found some vendors setting up shop in a vacant lot. An old man had a heap of carburetors in a shopping trolley. I pulled over to talk to him.
"G'day. I'm Firebird. This is Dorktown."
"Oldkoot" he said.
"You got a carb that will fit this V6?"
"This ain't much of a Ford town. But I think I got one that would fit."
I turned off the car and we got out.
While he was digging up the carburetor I grabbed two ancient pieces of grape Bubble Yum from my stash and tossed one to Dorktown. She unwrapped it and put it in her mouth. Her eyes lit up in delight.
Oldkoot showed me the carb. It had clearly been rebuilt with care. Clean as a whistle. New hand cut gaskets and everything.
"Did you rebuild this?" I asked.
"Yessirree."
"Looks great. Mind if I try it out?"
"Go right ahead."
I got to work putting it on. "How long have you been doing this kind of thing?"
"I've been building engines for dang near 50 years now. I worked at the GM plant when it was in its prime. We all did." He gestured at the other vendors.
"We're headed to the plant now. Can you give us directions?"
"It's just a few blocks thattaway. But you don't want to go there now."
"What do you mean?"
"We were refurbishing and selling old parts out of the place. I'd even put together a nice turbo V8. Yesterday some fopdoodle with a mohawk showed up acting like he owned the joint. Then some gollumpus in an old timey dive suit joined him. Said they were gonna start making cars again."
"That's what we were hoping to do. Are there enough parts left in the place to do it?" I asked.
"There are some subframes sitting around. Some sheet metal. No glass. Not enough parts to make a complete car. But you could probably get some kind of frankencar up and running."
"What did they do next?"
"They tried to get us to work for them. We asked how much they were gonna pay us. They said we wouldn't get a salary but we'd share in the profits if we sold any cars. None of us wanted to take that chance so we told them to go suck eggs. Then they took my V8 and kicked us out."
"This isn't the first time he's done shit like this" I said. Mohawk Asshole had taken over the Firebuddy factory I'd set up last year. My new factory in Arizona was well hidden for just this reason.
"That ain't the half of it" Oldkoot continued. "Next thing you know they've set up a guillotine out front."
"A guillotine?"
"Yep. Said they'd cut off our heads if we didn't leave town."
"Any more of the original plant workers still around?"
"The place was bombed in '81. Most of our coworkers were killed. Everyone else gave up or faded away. We're all that's left. This world ain't what it used to be."
"Don't worry" Dorktown said between smacks of her gum. "We're here to fix the world and kill the assholes that broke it."
"That's my girl" I said.
She smiled and swallowed her gum.
I put the air cleaner back on and started up the Pinto. I revved it up. "Sounds great. What do we owe you?" I asked.
"You chase those vermin out of Van Nuys and we're even."
"It's a deal. How many of them are there?"
"I couldn't rightly say. Their cronies have been moving trucks in and out of there all day. There are two guards out front by the guillotine. But you don't have to go in the front."
He reached into his pocket and handed me a single key on an old GM keychain. "This key opens the office door on the east side of the building."
"We'll go in tonight" I said.
"Fuck that" Dorktown said. She tried to snatch the key from me but I held on tight.
"Keep it" she said. "I'll go in through the front door."
She pulled the crossbow out of the Pinto and strutted off in the direction of the plant.
I threw my gum away and took off after her. She started running. I chased her and tackled her. We both went down and the crossbow slammed into a light post.
We got up. Dorktown picked up the crossbow. The string had snapped and the bow was bent.
She threw it aside. "I'll tear off his skin with my fingernails if I have to."
I blocked her path. She tried to push her way through me.
"Dorktown please listen to me."
I endured shoves and punches and kicks and scratches but I held fast.
"Dorktown. Please."
Now she was screaming and wailing.
"I know you miss him. I miss him too."
She looked up at me. She had tears in her eyes.
Firebird had tears in his eyes too.
Some things are better left unsaid.
This isn't one of those things.
"If you die there won't be anyone in my fan club" I said. "Remember in my book when Mohawk Asshole fell asleep at the wheel and we stole my car off the back of his tow truck? That was at 3am. So we'll go in at 3am ok?"
She took a few breaths and looked down at the sidewalk. I put my arm around her and we walked back.
We joined Oldkoot by the car. A deuce-and-a-half drove by headed toward the plant. Its occupants eyed us suspiciously.
"We're attracting attention" I said. "We need somewhere to hole up."
Oldkoot said "If you head southeast to Burbank there's a little place called the Safari Inn."
"You need a ride out of town?" I offered. I made the offer to the other vendors as well. They all turned me down.
"This place is all we know" Oldkoot said. "But thank you just the same."

Me and Dorktown got a room at the Safari Inn. The sky had yellow and orange and purple stripes going all the way across it.
The motel pools are all empty nowadays so I grabbed my skateboard and went to check it out.
I set my board on the coping and dropped in. I immediately slammed into a puddle of muck around the drain.
I heard Dorktown laughing at me. I looked up and saw her sitting on the edge of the pool with her legs dangling.
I was in me undies.
Yes you were. But I don't want them to think of you that way.
I don't mind.
Yes but you have more to offer than that. And that's not what this story is about.
Anyway Dorktown had my tape player with her. She pressed play. Bruce Springsteen. Rosalita Come Out Tonight. Live in Phoenix 1978. Four different women stormed the stage that night.
I dropped into the pool again. I pulled off a few ollies below the coping and even a little grind. I always skate better when I have someone to show off for.
I climbed out of the pool and grabbed a couple more pieces of Bubble Yum for us.
Dorktown swallowed hers a minute later.
"That's not how you do it. Watch."
I blew a bubble as big as Dorktown's head. Her eyes widened in amazement and she smiled.
It made me happy to see her smile.
"Let me try let me try!" she said.
I gave her my gum. She chewed it a bit. Then she tried to blow but she just spat it into my face.

The inn had one of those winding brass alarm clocks with bells on top. We'd set the alarm for 2:30am.
Dorktown was asleep. I was not.
I couldn't stop thinking about what I had to do. I knew it wasn't gonna be good. I checked my pocket to make sure I had my handcuffs and checked my keyring to make sure I had the key.
The alarm went off. Those bells are loud as fuck.
I picked up the axe. "It's time" I said.
Dorktown yawned. "Let's go do some murdering."
The car crept toward the plant. I kept the headlights off. We parked a block away.
I noticed that Firebird was wearing a watch so I asked him what time it was.
"I dunno" he said. "It's broken."
Then I realised he was still wearing the dive watch his dad had given him 38 years ago.
I pulled the cuffs out of my pocket. I slapped one of them onto the steering wheel.
"What are those for?" Dorktown asked.
I grabbed her wrist and slapped the other cuff onto it.
Asshole.
"What are you doing?" she cried.
"This isn't who you are" I said.
"You don't know who I am!"
"This isn't who I want you to be."
I got out and grabbed the axe. Dorktown freaked out and tugged at the steering wheel furiously to no avail. I headed for the assembly plant.
The facility was massive and made up of several buildings. It was painful to see such a bastion of industry and progress and prosperity reduced to a ghostly collection of blackened husks.
Light was coming from an open garage bay door on the main building. Silhouetted in front of the door were two guards with long blonde hair and an actual goddamn guillotine just like Oldkoot said. Parked out front was the deuce-and-a-half we'd seen earlier and a sand rail in addition to the Elsinore motorbike.
I went around back and used Oldkoot's key to sneak in through the darkened back door.
I had some trouble pushing the door open cuz something was leaning up against it. I squeezed my way in but in doing so I knocked over a pile of something.
I was greeted by Oldkoot's mutilated head on a pike just inches away from my face.
There were a dozen other heads on a dozen other pikes too. It was all the other plant workers who had refused to leave town.
If you came here to read about grisly murder well then there you go. But before you start wanking off to it I got some shit I wanna say.
They named the guillotine after a bloke named Guillotin. He was wholeheartedly against killing people. He was horrified when he found out what he would be forever remembered for. He never even built a guillotine. He just came up with the idea as a way to improve upon the long and agonizing spectacles that public executions had become. The guillotine was the quickest and most humane manner of inducing death anyone could come up with at the time. He hoped that performing executions in this abrupt and boring way would discourage the crowds of gawkers from showing up.
It didn't work. People were more excited than ever to watch others lose their lives. Children sang guillotine songs and played guillotine games. Artists made guillotine art. Families had miniature novelty guillotines for slicing vegetables. Jokes were made and idioms were born. Like "Heads will roll."
Doctors performed experiments on the heads. They'd talk to them and slap them and give them instructions they could respond to in order to see how long the heads would stay alive. The answer is somewhere between three and thirty seconds. Either end of that range sounds like way too long to me.
The Nazis were some of the biggest users of the guillotine. The last legal guillotine execution happened in 1977. Just as society was about to cease this savagery the Big Bang destroyed society and set off the savagery all over again.
I'd much rather drop someone out of a helicopter.
Why do you keep bringing up helicopters? You're missing the point. Killing is sometimes necessary but it's something you should avoid at all costs. If you're gonna kill someone it should only be to stop them from killing you or someone else. Life is the best goddamnedest thing that's ever happened to anyone in the whole entire universe and we should fucking appreciate it more.
It was probably not the best time to think about this shit cuz at that very moment I was carrying an axe down a hallway and planning to use that axe to take the life of another human being. But I'd had 38 years to prepare for this moment and new shit had come to light since the last time I'd had him in my sights. I'd shown him mercy that day. Page 129. But not this time. Never again.
I was in a dark hallway with several entrances to dark offices. I could see a dim light coming from around a corner up ahead. I rounded the corner and at the end of the hallway there was a door with a window in it. It led to the brightly lit main floor. Framed right in center of that window was the frankencar. The Frankenbird.
I walked up to the door and peeked through the window. Some asshole mechanic was working late putting the finishing touches on the abomination. He kept trying to start it up but he wasn't having any luck
The Frankenbird wasn't a Trans Am and it wasn't a Camaro but it was clearly made up of bits of both. The nose was from an '81 Firebird but the tail was from a Camaro. Side pipes with no heat shields and no mufflers. Gratings were welded on in the places where windows were supposed to be. It had a twotone paint job. The two tones were rust and primer. On the bonnet where the firebird logo was supposed to go they'd painted a bird's skeleton.
Oldkoot's handbuilt engine was jutting out of the bonnet but they'd piled dual stacked superchargers on top of it. Dual stacked superchargers on a turbocharged 4.9L V8. There was no way that engine could take all that fuel and air. I'd be surprised if they could even get it started. It looked like something I would have drawn in grade school which is to say it looked awesome and scary as hell.
Then someone snored loudly in the darkened office right beside me.
I froze for a moment. I waited for another snore then snuck in.
Someone was sleeping on a mattress in the center of the office. I inched closer. It was him. Mohawk Asshole. Still in his tuxedo.
He'd killed my family. He'd killed Messenger Kid. Who knows how many others had died because of him? It was time to put an end to this.
Damn right it was.
I lifted the axe and aimed for his neck.
Did you hesitate?
I did not hesitate.
You fucking hesitated. And I know why. Laura told me.
They don't know who Laura is yet. You're getting ahead of the story. This is kind of a pivotal moment.
At this point five major events happened in quick succession.
1. An engine cranked over a few times and the entire building started rumbling. The asshole mechanic had somehow managed to bring the Frankenbird to life.
2. Mohawk Asshole woke up with a start. He gave me a funny look.
3. The head fell off of my axe.
4. The butt of the axe head hit Mohawk Asshole in the forehead. It bounced to the floor.
5. A voice arose from a dark corner of the room and said "Dad?" I looked up. It was Chumdumpster. He was still in that dive suit. He must sleep in it.
This was a lot to take in. It would have been nice if the axe head had knocked Mohawk Asshole unconscious but instead it had imbued him with extreme consciousness.
He tried to get up. I started thwacking him with the axe handle. It was the best I could do and really we're all just doing the best we can.
Mohawk Asshole stood up and took the axe handle from me. He threw it across the room. Chumdumpster waddled towards me.
A light came on in the hallway. It was becoming apparent there were more people in these offices and they were now awake.
I bolted out of the room and slammed the door. I held it shut. Mohawk Asshole and Chumdumpster were tugging on the knob. They were a couple of knobtuggers. I gotta remember that one.
Ten assholes in stairstep camo fatigues came around the corner and stopped when they saw me. Every one of them had an AK47 that was clean and shiny which suggested to me it was probably also in good working order. And weirdly no matter what their gender or race or age every one of them had long blonde hair just like the two guards out front. Hair dye or wigs were used if necessary to achieve the look. I shall dub these assholes the Flirty Dozen.
I let go of the office door and kicked it in so it would knock over Asshole and Asshole Jr. I ran out the door that led to the main factory floor.
I looked at the Frankenbird. It was idling 50 metres away. I didn't have a chance of making it. But if I surrendered I'd just end up spending 30 seconds lying on the ground looking up at the sky and thinking how much it sucks to not have a body anymore.
Bullets shattered the door's glass window.
I took off running for the Frankenbird. The door flew open and every one of those clean and shiny M16s started going off while pointed in my general direction.
The mechanic stared at the Frankenbird's idling engine looking confused. He thought the gunshots were backfires.
Then there was the sound of another car approaching and a smash. One of the Flirty Dozen shouted "Hold your fire! It's a Pinto! Take cover!"
Dorktown was driving the Pinto while handcuffed to the wheel. She'd driven right into the guillotine smashing it into splinters and continued through the garage bay door.
She tried to run over Mohawk Asshole and Chumdumpster and the Flirty Dozen but they all ran out of her way. I'll forgive her for driving my car. This was an emergency and she was coming to my rescue.
No I wasn't. I was pissed off. I came to blow everything up with your exploding car.
I'm glad it didn't explode.
Thanks to Dorktown's distraction I made it to the Frankenbird. I slammed the bonnet down on the mechanic's head and pushed him out of the way. I hopped into the car and kicked it in the guts. We flogged it out of there and began the race for Norwood.CHAPTER 04: seligman

We headed out of Las Diablas on what was left of old Route 66. Mohawk Asshole took off after us in the sand rail. Chumdumpster was still riding the Elsinore. The Flirty Dozen piled into the deuce-and-a-half. The deuce had headlights but the sand rail and the Elsinore didn't so they all had to take it slow.
Thanks to Oldkoot the Pinto had a new carb and the Frankenbird had a new toey V8. So it didn't take long to put some distance between us and the assholes.
We took the back roads as much as possible. We had to stay off the highways to avoid the highway robbers. The highway robbers would block the road and charge a toll. And don't tell me we should just pay the toll. Sometimes the toll was something more than money. Especially for someone like Dorktown. That was a toll we were not gonna pay.
There hasn't been much traffic since the Big Bang. You usually have the road to yourself. But when you do see another vehicle it's usually a truck of some sort. Trucks have always been what keeps the economy alive. Good thing the Big Bang didn't take away the trucks. If you stopped the trucks you'd strangle a city within days.
I couldn't tell you how fast the Frankenbird was going cuz the speedo was broken. I can tell you she was thirsty though. We needed petrol so we stopped at Roy's Cafe in Amboy just as the sun was coming up.
"Let me out of these cuffs" Dorktown demanded. She did not look at me when she spoke.
"Will you fill up my tank?" I asked.
"Let me out of these cuffs" she repeated.
"Will you at least promise not to go on a murderous rampage?"
"Murderous rampage is the reason I'm here. Let me out of these bloody cuffs!" she screamed.
Roy the owner was standing by the front door. "If you two ain't buying no gas you'd best be on your way."
I took the cuffs off.
"What the fuck happened?" she asked me.
"Mohawk Asshole and Chumdumpster and the Flirty Dozen will be here any minute" I said. "They want the Frankenbird back and they wanna get to Norwood before we do. Most of all they wanna kill us. We gotta get some petrol right now or they're gonna cut off our heads."
Dorktown tuned to Roy. "Fill up both cars." Then she turned back to me. "What the fuck happened?"
"Oldkoot and the other factory workers are all dead."
"And Mohawk Asshole isn't."
"Mohawk Asshole had a goddamn army with him" I explained.
"Of course he had an army" she said casually. "He's the president of the Gillies."
This bombshell inspired more questions than it answered.
After a few seconds passed I finally figured out my biggest question. "I thought the president of the Gillies was killed in The Cage."
"He was. Mohawk Asshole was the vice president."
"What the fuck is a Gilly?"
"A Gilly is someone who cuts the heads off of Hellies."
"What the fuck is a Helly?"
"A Helly is someone who drops Gillies out of helicopters."
"What is it with you and helicopters?"
"It's how Hellies kill people. Drop the bad guys out of helicopters. Like Pinochet used to do."
Pinochet was a Chilean dictator propped up by the US government. My mom was an economist. She briefly worked with Pinochet back in the 70s. With my mother's help he saved Chile's economy. But he was also a murderous asshole. He killed thousands. So my mom didn't work for him for long. Capitalism is supposed to be about freedom. Laissez faire just means let stuff be. But Pinochet was a fascist capitalist. He thought he could force people to be free. He ruined the reputation of capitalism for generations to come. He was no hero. His was not an example to be emulated.
"Are you saying you're a Helly?" I asked.
"Of course I'm a Helly. I'm pretty sure you are too."
"No fucking way. The only thing I know for sure about Hellies and Gillies is I am neither one of those things."
"You have to be one or the other" she said. "Only evil stands to benefit from a compromise. It's like mixing water with poison."
I rested my face on my palm. "If all you have is a line defined by two points then yeah maybe you have to pick one side or the other. But there are other dimensions. Three points and you have a plane. Four points and you have a solid. My ideas are three dimensional."
"Whatever. If you're not a Helly that's fine with me. But it was your book that got me interested in politics in the first place."
"I don't write about politics. I write about economics."
"What's the difference?" she asked.
"Economics is the science of proving politics shouldn't exist. Politics is the art of pretending economics doesn't exist." I was proud of that one. I should put that on a tshirt.
Dorktown rolled her eyes. "Are we gonna assassinate this asshole or what?" she asked.
"We're not assassinating anyone" I said.
"What do you mean?"
"This isn't political."
"If you kill a president it's gonna be political."
Ok she had a point there.
I looked up and saw headlights approaching from the west. I turned to Roy. "We're in a bit of a hurry."
"I'm squeezing this here handle as hard as I can" he said. "But you're welcome to round up and pay me now."
I looked at Dorktown. She got out her Firebuddy and send the bloke some Firebucks.
"Oh wow" she said.
"What?"
"You got a befriending request from Count Bartholomu Bubury. He says thanks again for saving his life."
"The president of the Hellies? Tell him to go jump out of a helicopter. Are you ok to drive?"
"We'll sleep when Mohawk Asshole is dead. What's our next stop?"
"My Firebuddy factory in Seligman. We can get weapons there."
"What's the address?"
"Just stay close behind me. Keep up your speed so they can't follow us in. Mohawk Asshole doesn't know the location of the new factory and we need to keep it that way. I don't want a rerun of what happened to the old factory."
Mohawk Asshole took over my previous factory and made ripoff Firebuddies I call Assholebuddies. I've seen several Assholebuddies around but I've never seen one that actually worked.
The headlights were getting closer. Roy finished up and we hightailed it out of there. But as soon as we got started Dorktown ran into trouble. The Pinto was dragging its feet again. I started losing her when I got the Frankenbird up over a hundred kays. Maybe bad petrol. Maybe Oldkoot's carb was acting up.
I pulled over and got out.
"What's wrong?" I asked.
"I dunno" Dorktown said. "I got the pedal to the metal."
"If we can make it to Seligman we'll leave the Pinto there. If we're in the same car we can take turns driving and sleeping."
"I'll keep an eye on the rear vision mirror. If they start to catch up I'll flash my lights. You can come back for me and we'll ditch the Pinto."
I got back into the Frankenbird and we continued toward Seligman at a snail's pace. Well maybe the pace of a snail rolling down a hill. But not a very steep hill.

We made it to Seligman. Dorktown hadn't flashed her lights so I headed for the old airport and she followed. I pulled off to a big vacant space beside the crumbling runways. Or at least I'd made sure it looked vacant. Me and Dorktown stopped and got out of our cars.
"Where are we?" she asked.
"My Firebuddy factory" I said with arms outstretched.
I pulled out a remote control and pressed a button. A massive hinged door slowly lifted up off the ground in front of us revealing a ramp leading down into my underground factory.
"Now that's impressive" she said.
"I used to be a millionaire. Come on. We can drive the cars in."
We brought the cars into the factory. I reached out of my window and pressed a button on the wall to shut the main door. We parked the cars in a small parking area I had set up by the main door.
My factory manager Laura greeted us as my technicians continued their work. I introduced Laura to Dorktown.
You skipped something.
What do you mean?
The Tim Tams.
Right. I noticed that Dorktown had eaten an old package of Tim Tams I'd left in the glovebox of the Pinto.
You were pissed off!!
I didn't say you could eat them.
You went to look for them and you freaked out when you found out they were gone. You took the empty wrapper out of the glovebox and saved it.
That's what this is about?
Damn right it is. Because those Tim Tams were special. I figured it out. They were the Tim Tams you bought for your sister 38 years ago. You said you'd eaten them on the day she died. Page 6. Just like you said you chucked your dad's broken watch. Page 34. But you still had it. I bet you still have that Hot Wheels Trans Am too.
I do. It's a cool toy.
Your mother was holding it in her hand when Mohawk Asshole blew her to smithereens.
That's right Dorktown. And there's one more thing I've held on to. In fact I'd been planning on giving it to you.
What is it??
I'll tell you later. Let's get back to the story.
I took Dorktown to the weapons room where I had five Martin Warthog compound bows and eight Ka-Bar knives.
"These are the weapons we came here for?" Dorktown asked. She sounded annoyed.
"Do you have any idea what I had to do to get a hold of these bows in this condition?"
"This isn't Sherwood Forest. Mohawk Asshole has guns."
"Next time I'll build a gun factory."
We cleaned out the weapons room and packed everything into the boot of the Frankenbird.
"Got any money here?" Dorktown asked.
"Yeah but we can't take it. If anything I should be leaving money behind. If I don't get that lunchbox full of money back I'm going to have to lay everyone off."
At this point I laid down on a couch we kept outside Laura's office and made the mistake of dozing off.
I talked to Laura while you were asleep.
She's not the only one you talked to.
Now who's getting ahead of the story??
You lied to me.
You lied to me too.
You're ruining the story.
The story already sucked!!
It's not just a story. It's life.
Life sucks.
You don't know how it ends yet.
I apologize for the nonlinear narration style of my mission partner (ex mission partner!!). I think it's safe to assume that what you'd like to hear about right now is the events that transpired next. So that's what I'm gonna tell you.
We left the Pinto behind and took off in the Frankenbird armed to the teeth. Dorktown was suspiciously quiet. She played with her Firebuddy the whole time.
The next servo we found was the old Texaco station in Ash Fork so we pulled off there. Dorktown ran inside so I followed her.
"You got any food here?" she asked the owner.
"Burgers and hot dogs" he said.
We sat down. The owner adjusted the squelch on an old CB radio that was buzzing and chirping behind the counter. Back in the 70s everyone realized how cool truckers were and truckers had CB radios so everyone bought CB radios so they could be as cool as the truckers. My parents even had one in their station wagon. The owner was a bit younger than me but probably still a prewar.
The radio behind the counter mostly made static noises but every now and then it sounded like there might be a human voice out there like a ghost visiting from another time.
"I'll have 25 burgers for takeaway" Dorktown said.
"You hungry?" I asked.
She ignored me.
I was pissed off. Are you gonna tell them or should I??
Go right ahead. You tell my story. I'll tell yours.
When you introduced me to Laura I immediately knew who she was. I recognised her by her necklace made out of paperclips. You described that necklace in your book. Laura's husband made it for her. Laura is the woman who blamed you for her husband's death. She had you at gunpoint. You told me you grabbed her gun and shot her. But she's alive. Not only that but you're friends. You work together.
I was trying to tell a story.
You were trying to make us think you're someone you're not. You know what you are?? You're a goddamn softcock.
Ok. I didn't kill Laura. I didn't kill Mohawk Asshole. The truth is I've never killed anyone. Does that make me a bad person?
No it just makes you a bad murderer.
You've never killed anyone either.
Yeah but when I do I promise you I'm gonna be really fucking good at it.
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
Oh I hope it does.
I heard a helicopter approaching.
The servo owner was filling up a sack with Dorktown's strangely large order of hamburgers.
Dorktown handed me her Firebuddy. "Some shit's about to go down. You might wanna update your story."
"I thought it was our story."
Dorktown grabbed the sack of burgers and ran outside. I followed her out and looked up at the sky while the servo owner peeked out the window.
It was not just one helicopter. It was a dozen of them. These days seeing one working helicopter was a big deal so seeing a dozen of them all at once was a deal that was a dozen times bigger. Most of them were military choppers too which was even more surprising to see nowadays. Hueys. Loaches. Kiowas. And you won't believe what was bringing up the rear. It was the last of the ACH-47A Chinooks. Nicknamed "Easy Money." They'd only made four of them and only one had made it back from Vietnam. These special Chinooks were known as "Guns-A-Go-Go" because they were loaded with .50 caliber machine guns and rockets and grenade launchers pointing in every direction. The thing was armored so it could take abuse as well as dish it out.
We stood by as all twelve of the helicopters landed on the main drag of Ash Fork. They kept the blades spinning. The roar of the engines was deafening. The downwash kicked dust into our eyes.
Dorktown turned to me. "Mohawk Asshole has an army" she said. "Now I have one too."
A bloke wearing a flight helmet and flecktarn camo fatigues hopped out of Easy Money and came toward us. He shook Dorktown's hand and said a few words to her. Then he headed right for me. He took off his helmet.
"Nice to see you again Firebird" he shouted.
It was Count Bartholomu Bubury. President Of The Hellies. Killer of the previous Gilly president.
He held out his hand. I didn't take it. He dropped his hand back down to his side but kept up the friendly act.
"I wanted to thank you personally." Bubury boomed. "This mission wouldn't have been possible without you. It's gonna be a righteous bloodbath. Wanna tag along? Witness the carnage?"
I shook my head.
"Suit yourself" he said. "Keep an eye on You Are Awaited. We'll post pictures of the bodies."
He gave me a politician's smile and a wink and he reboarded the Chinook.
Dorktown was handing out hamburgers to all the Helly soldiers in the helicopters. When she was done she climbed into Easy Money. She looked at me and said "Smell you later crocodile."
I ran back into the Texaco and checked my Firebuddy.
Dorktown had used my You Are Awaited account to accept Bubury's befriending request and communicate with him. I could see the log of their conversation. She told him she had been deliberately driving the Pinto slowly to allow the Gilly army to keep up with us. She told him that they could expect to find the Gilly army at my factory in Seligman.
And now the Hellies and Gillies were gonna use my factory as a battleground.
A message from Laura popped up. "Mohawk Asshole has the factory surrounded. They've got both the main door and the evac tunnel. The weapons room is empty."
"Divvy up the cash evenly and hand it out" I replied. "I'll be there in fifteen minutes." Seligman was thirty minutes away.
The helicopters were taking off and leaving Ash Fork one by one. I begged the owner to loan me some petrol. I told him it would save the lives of 28 factory workers. He shrugged. I promised to pay him back triple. No dice.
I sat down and folded my arms and laid my head down just like they used to make us do in elementary school when they wanted us to keep quiet.
I didn't know what to tell Laura. What do you say to a friend when you're about to leave them to die? I'll make sure to stop by and bury you tomorrow?
Then the servo owner asked "What did she mean when she told you to update your story? Are you a writer?"
"I'm not a writer" I mumbled into the counter. "I'm just someone who writes down stuff that happens in my life."
"Sounds like a roundabout way of saying you're a writer."
Then he noticed the Firebird symbol on my jacket. He looked outside and saw the Frankenbird. Then he looked back at me.
"You're  Firebird!" he exclaimed.
"Yeah."
"Oh boy. Have I got something to show you."
"I have to find a way back to Seligman right now."
"I'll get you back to Seligman" he said. "Just let me show you something first." He motioned for me to follow him into his office.
The office walls were covered in GM and Pontiac and Firebird memorabilia. Flags. Neon signs. Badges. Patches. Stickers. Framed and autographed prints from Smokey and the Bandit and even Hooper. He even had the actual Bandit Trans Am jacket Burt Reynolds had owned. And right there in the middle of it all was a copy of my book. He grabbed it and handed it to me.
"Will you please sign this?" he asked.
"Will you fill up my car?"
"I'll fill up your car if you sign it. And if you put me in your next book."
"I'm not writing a book."
"You said you were writing down stuff that happens. It might be a book someday."
"I can't just put you in a book. You have to do something interesting."
"I will. I promise."
I chuckled. "Ok. What's your name?"
He told me his name. I took the book and signed it. "Congratulations. You're the new president of my one member fan club. The last one resigned."
We went out to the car and he started filling up the tank.
"Great ride" he said. "Nowhere near original but you can tell she's got moxie."
"Did you ever own a Firebird?" I asked.
"Nope. I always dreamed of it. But the Big Bang put an end to all that."
"Not necessarily" I said. "I'm trying to get to Norwood to reopen the factory and build some new Trans Ams."
"Is that what your next book is about?"
"It's not a book."
"It ain't never gonna be with that attitude." he said. He put the cap back on and replaced the nozzle. "Life's a story. Let's make it a good one. Why are we going back to Seligman?" he asked.
"We?"
"I have to do something interesting to get in your book right? Well let's do it. Let's fuck shit up."
I was starting to like this bloke. "We're gonna fight two armies at once" I explained. "We're gonna lose. But if we're lucky we'll save the lives of 28 factory workers."
"What about the girl?"
"What do you mean?"
"Do we kill her or rescue her?"
"If she's shooting at us we kill her. If she's crying we rescue her."
The slowest of those helicopters could cruise at 200 kays. But they'd be getting there as the crow flies and we'd be getting there as the Firebird drives so we had to beat their 200 kays by a lot.
If Frankenbird makes it there in time I'll give Oldkoot's severed head a kiss on the lips. Ok maybe not that. Maybe I'll hire a plane to write his name in the sky or something.
I put the pedal to the floor. First. Second. Third. Fourth. Redline then beyond. Oldkoot's engine knew what it could give and what it could take. And boy did it make a hell of a racket. We caught up to those damned helicopters and by the time we got into Seligman we were just ahead of them.
I parked a good distance away from the factory and stashed the Frankenbird where no one would see it. We each grabbed a bow and a knife from the boot and snuck up on the assholes.
The deuce and a half and the sand rail and the Elsinore were parked at the main door. Mohawk Asshole and Chumdumpster and most of the Flirty Dozen were trying to force it open. They'd pried it up a bit and were shooting down into the gap.
The evac tunnel exit was a hatch in the floor of a shack a couple hundred metres from the rest of the factory. The door of the shack was wide open but the hatch in the floor was still sealed. One of the assholes was trying to figure out how to get it open.
We headed for the asshole in the shack. When we got close we stopped and took cover behind a crumbling wall. I peeked around and made sure I had a good view of him through the shack's open door.
I nocked an arrow and held on to the bowstring. I peeked around again and drew the bowstring back. I aimed and I let the arrow fly.
In my youth I'd had access to a nice stockpile of guns that Mohawk Asshole had left in the trunk of the car I stole from him. The first car I stole from him I mean. Anyway as Dorktown figured out I had never actually used those guns to kill anyone. That was cuz I didn't have to. I had so many guns that no one messed with me. I mastered those guns just in case I'd ever have to use one of them. But I wasn't so good with a bow.
My arrow missed its mark and now we had the asshole's attention. He took cover and pointed his AK47 at us.
I peeked around the corner again and he fired a single round. The round knocked a chip out of the wall. The chip hit me in the face and knocked off my hat. I snatched my hat off the ground.
I wiped my forehead and saw blood on my hand. I looked at the assholes at the main door. They'd heard the shot and now we had their attention too.
They all started heading our way. And now the helicopters were approaching too.
We were fucked. But then my new mission partner decided to do something interesting.
"Put me in your book" he said. That was all the warning I had. He grabbed his knife and took off running for the shack.
I emerged from cover and started firing off arrows as quickly as I could. They went in random directions but the barrage knocked the asshole off his game a little. He ducked behind the door until he realized someone was coming right for him. He popped back out and started putting bullets in my partner. My partner just kept going. He ran right up to the asshole and stabbed him in the neck. Then they both flopped down on the floor and carked it. It was all over in just a few seconds. Thanks partner. What was your name again? Fuck.
I rolled the bodies off the hatch and pressed another button on my remote. The hatch opened and Laura was waiting right beneath it. She shouted to my technicians and started guiding everyone out. She wasn't gonna leave until everyone was safe.
I looked out the door of the shack toward the main door and saw that the assholes were getting closer so I took the dead guy's AK47 and started firing. The assholes hit the deck.
I turned around to check on my workers. They had all scattered into the distance with my cash reserves.
Enjoy your severance pay. We had a good run.
It was down to me and Laura now.
The helicopters arrived and started strafing the place. We were far enough away from the main door that we avoided the brunt of it. The sand rail was the first victim and the deuce was next. Their tires were gone and fluids were spraying.
We had a pretty clear path back to the Frankenbird but before we left I asked myself what I'd be leaving behind for the assholes to take. The money and weapons were gone but the Pinto was still in there. And Dorktown's assertions to the contrary notwithstanding it would be running great with Oldkoot's nice new carb on it.
I handed the AK47 to Laura. "I'll be right back."
I jumped into the hatch while Laura covered me. I ran back into the main factory which was now dark except for some red emergency lights. I headed for the Pinto while .50 caliber bullets poked holes in the roof. I would have put a better roof on the place but when I built it I was only a millionaire not a ten millionaire.
I reached into the Pinto and pulled out the keys. But then I thought about that for a second and put the keys back in. Instead of taking the keys I dug up a hammer and smashed out the headlights. Then I hit the button to open the main door. That would draw the assholes in while I ran for the evac hatch.
As I ran through the evac tunnel Easy Money started in with the grenades and rockets. Dirt and rocks were falling in my face. The tunnel was collapsing around me. Fuck you Dorktown.
Ok now I'm kind of missing the way Dorktown used to read what I'd written and go in and type shit in between my paragraphs. Dorktown if you read this someday I give you permission to tell me to go fuck myself in the margins.
Anyway I crawled out of the hatch and me and Laura made a run for the Frankenbird. Mohawk Asshole and Chumdumpster were not gonna let me go that easy though. Mohawk Asshole came flying out of the factory ramp in the Pinto and Chumdumpster followed him on the Elsinore. We slipped away from the helicopters in the dust and smoke and confusion while the Flirty Dozen got turned into beef mince and cherry pie.


MA and CD should leave the main entrance sooner, FB should draw him away, to explain how MA and CD escaped getting killed by the hellies, but they're still in Seligman somewhere, when the bodies start dropping from helicopters, a body lands right on FB's car



make it clear MA is sad about the first FD we kill, then have him witness the deaths of ALL of the FB


figure out some sensible plan for the pinto being stolen, why would the headlights be out, and if the headlights need to be out at all, and if MA dies in the crash and CD is thrown from the bike
