CHAPTER 0: tomorrowland
"Tomorrowland Weekend! Tomorrowland Weekend! Where the Big Bang never happened! You are awaited at Tomorrowland Weekend!"
Carnival barking isn't my style so I paid a bloke to shout this stuff for me. Some of my other employees were putting up the new sign that said "Tomorrowland Weekend" and taking down the old one that said "The Gathering."
The Gathering was this annual event in the California desert where people came from all over the world to meet up with family and friends. This year I'd paid for the whole thing myself and jazzed it up to look like a parallel universe where the apocalypse never happened.
"Tomorrowland Weekend! Where there's no suffering! No hunger! No politics! No war! Nothing to fight about. The shoes have shoelaces. The cars have guzzoline. And the streets are paved with asphalt!"
Hundreds of people were lined up at the gate and I was the gatekeeper. To get into Tomorrowland Weekend you had to.... Well I'll let my carnival barker explain it.
"Costumes and Firebuddy required for entry!" he barked. "If you do not have a Firebuddy you can buy one at the door."
The Firebuddy was a "laptop" computer I'd invented. I called it a laptop cuz it was small enough to fit in your lap. It was Firebuddy sales that had paid for this event and this event was gonna help me sell more Firebuddies.
Costumes were required and instead of boring old campsites we'd all build little office buildings and flower shops and libraries so for a while life could be beautiful and boring like it was when we were kids.
At this point a lot of people had already come through my line and entered the event. But to give you a feel for what it was like I'm gonna start this story at the moment where my next customer was an impeccably dressed man. Suit and tie and hat and everything. It had been 38 years since the Big Bang so I was sure it had been 38 years since I'd seen someone dressed up that nice. I remembered being a kid seeing my dad off to work and he'd be dressed like that.
"What are you supposed to be?" I asked.
"I'm an insurance salesman" he said. "Hi. How are you. How are the wife and kids? Can I interest you in a policy of insurance?" He handed me his business card.
"Nailing it. Where'd you get the suit?"
"Found it in a bunker."
"Far out." I said. He showed me his Firebuddy and I waved him in. "The briefcase is a nice touch."
Next guy had on a red hat and a yellow coat. He carried an axe. He offered me a metal bucket full of coins but I was more interested in the axe.
"Nice fireman gettup. That axe is in great shape mate."
"The head's a little loose" he said. He handed it to me so I could take a closer look.
"Looks good to me" I said. "Wanna keep your shrapnel and barter me this instead?"
He took me up on the deal. He gave me the axe and his business card. I handed him a Firebuddy.
A woman in a homemade blue uniform was next.
"What are you?" I asked.
"I'm a police officer!" she said enthusiastically. "Have you done any crimes?"
"Crimes against humanity" I replied.
"Remain silent" she chuckled.
She handed me a frame holding a torn and stained twenty dollar bill pressed between two sheets of plexiglass. Ugh.
"You don't have coins?" I asked.
"This is all I've got."
"You're gonna have to take it out of there. And you're not getting change."
Nowadays most people were using Firebucks which was a computerized currency I'd come up with. But to use Firebucks you had to have a Firebuddy or some other kind of computer.
She put the frame on the ground and borrowed my new axe to break it open. She handed the axe back to me. "Head's a little loose" she said.
I took another look at the axe and shrugged.
She pulled the sheets of plastic apart and carefully handed me the bill. I handed her a Firebuddy.
She started walking away but then she stopped and turned back. "I almost forgot" she said. She handed me her business card.
I had a little table set up with two of my childhood lunchboxes on it. The business cards went into my Pac Man lunchbox. The money went into my Six Million Dollar Man lunchbox. Both of them were overflowing.
One guy was dressed as a race car driver. Another was a movie star. There was a doctor. There was even someone dressed up as a thief but to me she looked more like the Hamburglar. The prewars were living out their stolen childhood dreams. The postwars were dreaming of a world they'd heard about but never known.
The next customer in line said to me "Fuck this is cool. Are you really Firebird?"
She was a teenage girl with an Australian accent. It was nice to hear an Aussie again. When I was a little tacker I lived in the USA but after the Big Bang I was stuck in Australia for a few years. I kinda missed the place.
"Used to be" I said. "But the car I was named for was smashed to bits."
"What do you drive now?"
"A 77 Ford Pinto."
"Ok Pinto" she said. "Will you sign my book?" She handed me a copy of a book I'd written last year called Awaited: Nonfictional Delusion.
"Make it out to Torkdown" she added.
"Dorktown?"
"Torkdown."
"To Dorktown" I said. "Love Pinto." I scribbled it just like I said it.
"How can I get to Tomorrowland?" she asked.
"Buy a Firebuddy" I told her. "And get some new clothes. What are you supposed to be? A homeless orphan? You can't wear that here. It breaks immersion."
"Not Tomorrowland Weekend" the girl said. "The real Tomorrowland. Like in your book."
My book was about a world called Tomorrowland. Tomorrowland was just like our world except that in Tomorrowland the Big Bang never happened. A lot of people had read that book and taken it way too seriously. A lot of people had gotten it into their heads that Tomorrowland was a real place you could go and visit.
That's what gave me the idea for Tomorrowland Weekend. Tomorrowland Weekend wouldn't just be a party in the desert. It would be a chance to live in the world I'd written about. A place to share knowledge and move humanity forward. We'd make history and we'd make the future. We would be more than attendees of some dumb festival. We would be tomorrowlanders. It would be a lifestyle. An identity. A culture. A family. Tomorrowlanders would rebuild the world together and this time we'd do it right.
"You gotta buy a Firebuddy." I repeated. "You gotta dress up. Then I let you in. While you're in there maybe you'll swap timelines with another version of yourself and teleport into the real Tomorrowland. Maybe not. Maybe you'll just buy a Firebuddy and go home. Are you buying one or what?"
"I don't have any money" she said.
"Ulfsbane!" I shouted.
My hired hunk appeared.
"Take her to the highway and let her hitchhike back to Australia."
At that moment a skirmish broke out in line. Ulfsbane got distracted and the girl ran off.
The race car driver and the movie star I told you about earlier had knives in their hands and they had a construction worker on the ground. He was unarmed. They'd already cut him up good and they were about to finish the job.
"Show us what he looks like on the inside!" somebody shouted.
But then someone else shouted "No fighting at the Gathering except for in the Cage!"
The fighting paused and all eyes turned to me. I hated making decisions like this.
"It's not the Gathering anymore. It's Tomorrowland Weekend. But the old rule still applies."
"You don't get it" the race car driver explained. "He's a Helly."
Someone shouted "Kill all Hellies."
I turned to Ulfsbane. "What's a Helly?"
Ulfsbane grunted.
The movie star said "And we're not inside the Gathering yet. So there ain't no rules." She pointed to some orange tape I'd nailed to the ground beneath the sign to mark the boundaries of the event.
I had to think fast if I didn't want a dead body stinking up the line. I went over to the tape on the ground and pulled it up and away from the entrance gate. I unspooled some more tape and walked it around the brawlers and back to the gate. I put a couple new nails into the ground to hold the tape in its new position.
"Welcome to Tomorrowland Weekend" I said to the three of them.
The movie star showed me her Firebuddy and threw a business card on my table.
"See you in the Cage Helly" the race car driver said to the construction worker.
I wasn't a fan of the Cage but it was pretty much an institution at this point. The Cage was where instead of fighting in the streets you'd lock two people in a ring together and let them have it out until one of them was dead.
The race car driver handed me his money and grabbed a Firebuddy from the stack. He gave me a business card that read "Dr. Freaky Freedoms PhD. President Of The Gillies. Kill All Hellies."
"What's a Gilly?" I asked Ulfsbane.
Ulfsbane grunted.
The construction worker got up and showed me his Firebuddy. "You did the right thing" he said. "You're on the winning side of history."
"I'm not on any side of history" I replied.
He handed me his business card. It was covered in blood. It read "Count Bartholomu Bubury. President Of The Hellies. Death to Gillies."
So it was to be a battle between two presidents. Whatever.
Count Bartholomu Bubury went in. Someone in a doctor outfit was next in line.
"That man needs medical attention" I said to her.
Her eyes narrowed over her surgical mask. "When you saved that man's life you sent a message loud and clear that you want to take away the lives of people like me."
"What kind of a person are you?" I asked.
"You should be asking yourself that question" she hissed.
Later that night hundreds of people stood outside the Cage screaming and cheering and banging on the fence and I stood at the center of it all.
"Welcome to the first ever Tomorrowland Weekend!" I shouted into the microphone.
The crowd went wild. They were thirsty for blood. I gestured for everyone to quiet down and then I continued.
"People have come from all over the world to be here tonight. Some of us are here to find thems we're looking for and thems we've lost. Some of us are here to make money. Some of us are here to have a good time. But there's one thing we all have in common. Every one of us is here because we want to build a better tomorrow!" I paused for a big cheer but it didn't happen.
"Death to Gillies!" someone shouted.
"Kill all Hellies!" someone retorted.
They all started shouting back and forth and I had to shout into the microphone again to get them to shut up.
"Death comes soon enough!" I said. "It doesn't matter if you're a Helly or a Gilly. What matters is that we are all tomorrowlanders!"
A bottle flew at me from a random direction. I jumped back and it shattered at my feet. It was time to give them what they wanted.
"Dollars to wingnuts every one of us here tonight has killed someone at some point in our lives. But here we kill each other in a civilized manner!"
Now the crowd was getting worked up.
"Tonight's Cage match is not just any Cage match. It's a battle between two presidents. In this corner we have Count Bartholomu Bubury. President Of The Hellies!"
Half the crowd cheered.
"And in this corner we have Dr. Freaky Freedoms. President Of The Gillies!"
The other half cheered.
I handed swords to both of them and got the heck out of there. I handed the microphone to my carnival barker on the way out.
"You're not gonna stay?" he asked.
"I'm trying to retain my humanity" I said.
He laughed. "Best of luck with that."
I went back to my trailer and fired up my Firebuddy. Firebuddies automatically connected to other computers in your vicinity to let you communicate with them and the rest of the network.
I logged into a "social networking website" I'd built called You Are Awaited. The messages people posted on You Are Awaited used to be friendly and positive. But lately things were different. People had started posting things like "If you're a Gilly we can't be friends" and "Hellies should be lined up and shot." I scrolled through the messages. There was no end to the vitriol.
My algorithm had noticed that people were keen to talk about this stuff so it had encouraged them. But the algorithm had not sparked reasoned debate. Instead it had radicalized both sides and no one was listening to each other. There was even talk of civil war.
What had I done?CHAPTER 1: dorktown
I answered a knock at the door. It was that Aussie girl Dorktown.
"You again? Ulfsbane!" I shouted.
"Fuck no please wait" she said. "I have a Firebuddy now. Ulfsbane let me in." She showed me her new laptop.
"I thought you didn't have any money."
"I don't."
"How did you get a Firebuddy?"
"Somebody gave me one."
"You still look like a ragamuffin."
"Oh yeah?" she countered. "What's with the cowboy hat and leather jacket?"
"I'm a software engineer named John Binns attending a festival called Wasteland Weekend where we celebrate the apocalypse."
She giggled. It was a reference from that book I'd written. The one she'd asked me to sign. I mean my name really was John Binns but if your name was Potty Wastebaskets you'd change it too. So I go by Firebird.
"What do you want?" I asked.
"I have a surprise for you."
"I hate surprises."
"A friend of yours is here to see you."
"I don't have any friends."
"Yes you do. You wrote about him in your book. But Ulfsbane won't let him in."
I thought about everyone I'd written about in my book. After all these years there was one person I'd always wondered about. One person I'd always hoped to see at the Gathering. One person whose name I hoped I'd never see on the Gathering's memorial wall.
Could it be Messenger Kid?
"All right let's go" I said.
When we stepped outside I looked over at the Cage. Spectators had climbed up the sides and onto the top. The entire structure was rocking back and forth. The crowd hooted and hollered like animals. Hopefully tonight this Hellies and Gillies stuff would be decided once and for all and I'd never have to hear about it again.
We headed away from the Cage and toward the entrance gate. The light at the gate was out and Ulfsbane was trying to fix it. All I could see was the silhouette of a man who was definitely not Messenger Kid.
We were just a few feet away when the light suddenly flickered on and lit up his face.
"G'day mate!" said a maniacal grinning mohawked head.
I leaped back in terror and fell to the ground. "Jesus freaking Crimean Peninsula" I said.
Dorktown giggled. "I found Bruce!" she said.
Yeah his real name was Bruce but I referred to him as Mohawk Asshole. The name is kinda dumb but I gave it to him when I was ten years old so what can I say. He got his first name cuz he had a mohawk. He got his last name cuz he killed my family.
And if you're wondering how I got the name Firebird it's cuz after Mohawk Asshole killed my family I stole his Stellar Blue 1975 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am and drove it around for a couple decades.
I got up off the ground and pulled out my FP45 Liberator. I twisted the cocking knob into place and stuck it in Mohawk Asshole's face. It was a crap gun and it only held one shot but one shot was all I'd need.
"No fighting at the Gathering except for in the Cage" he said calmly.
Dorktown grabbed my arm. "What are you doing? Aren't you two best mates now?" She got out her book and started flipping through the pages.
I was beginning to tire of people treating my book like it was an oracle of truth just because it had the word "nonfictional" in the title. But it was people taking my book seriously that had made this whole festival possible. And Dorktown was technically right. At the end of that book I'd refrained from killing Mohawk Asshole because we'd become friends in a roundabout way.
I put the gun away. "It's Tomorrowland Weekend" I said. "And you're not allowed in."
"I'm already in" he said. He pointed at the tape on the ground that I'd relocated earlier that day. Ok he had a point.
"Dammit Ulfsbane" I said.
Ulfsbane looked at the tape and grunted.
"We're going back to my trailer to catch up. Don't let in any more psychotic killers."
"There goes all your customers" Dorktown said.
"Don't you want his autograph too?" I asked Dorktown.
"Already got it" she replied.
To make things weirder Mohawk Asshole was wearing a tuxedo. "What are you supposed to be anyway?"
"I'm a millionaire at a fundraiser for the reelection of Ronald Reagan" he said.
I sat the two of them down in my trailer and shut the door.
"What do you two want?" I asked.
They both started blabbering.
I pointed at Mohawk Asshole. "You first."
"Thought I'd pay you a visit. Have a cuppa tea."
"I appreciate the buddy buddy act" I told him. "But we both know it's an act."
"All right then" he said. "Give me my car back and I won't tell anyone your secret."
Dorktown looked at me. "What's your secret?"
I ignored her. I reached into my jacket pocket and took out the Firebird's VIN plate. I tossed it to him. "That's all that's left of the car."
He looked at the VIN plate and started reading aloud. But he wasn't reading the letters and numbers. He remembered what the letters and numbers meant. He was decoding them. He'd loved that car as much as I had. "Pontiac. Trans Am. 2 door coupe. 455 cubic inch 4 barrel V8. 1975." He paused and looked up before translating the last letter. We both knew it by heart. It was the letter N.
"They ain't never gonna make another car like that again" I said.
"Why not?" Dorktown asked. "Why not make a new Firebird?"
I looked at Dorktown. I looked at Mohawk Asshole.
"Norwood" he said. He got up so fast he knocked over his chair. He ran out the door and started yelling at whoever would listen and also at whoever would not listen.
"There is no Tomorrowland!" he shouted. "Firebird's book is a lie! Tomorrowland doesn't exist!"
"That's the secret?" Dorktown asked. "Nobody can swap timelines?"
At this point I should probably clarify that the reason tomorrowlanders all believed they could come to this event and teleport into an alternate universe known as Tomorrowland did indeed have something to do with that book I wrote. In the book I claimed it was possible for people to swap places with doppelganger versions of themselves living in a nonapocalyptic alternate timeline called Tomorrowland. I claimed I'd visited Tomorrowland on multiple occasions. I claimed Mohawk Asshole had vanished into Tomorrowland and left in his place a friendly Mr. Rogers version of himself I called Bruce.
It was all just advertising. I was selling futuristic computers. I never expected anyone would actually believe the computers came from the future.
"The book is fiction" I said.
"What's fiction?" Dorktown asked.
"Nobody can swap timelines."
"So that was Mohawk Asshole? Not Bruce?"
"Correct."
Dorktown stood up. "Tomorrowland doesn't exist?"
"It exists in our hearts."
"I came all the way around the world for this."
"Tomorrowland is the friends you made along the way."
"Fuck you" she said. "I can kill him with or without you." She stormed out.
I followed her out and grabbed her by the arm.
"Kill who?" I asked.
A rising tide of crowd noises emanated from the direction of the Cage. I turned to look. It was covered top to bottom with people and the entire structure was leaning to one side.
"I'd tell you if you'd listen to me for one bloody second" Dorktown said.
I turned to look her in the eye. "Why are you here Dorktown?"
"My name is Torkdown." She held my gaze with fire in her eyes. "And I'm here to kill Mohawk Asshole."
"Why?"
"He killed my pop."
"Who was your pop?"
"You used to call him Messenger Kid."
Just then there was a loud crack and a massive ground shaking smash followed by terrified screams. The Cage had collapsed. I felt the heat of an explosion behind me and Dorktown's face lit up orange.
Neither of us turned and neither of us blinked.
Now let me explain who Messenger Kid is. Or should I say was. I refuse to write a flashback because I hate flashbacks. Time moves forward in a linear fashion. I ain't saying I'm happy about that. Especially when it comes to Messenger Kid. But if that's how time moves then stories should move that way too. So I'm just gonna tell it how I remember it.
Back when the world went to heck I found myself stuck in Australia. Aside from my girlfriend I had only one friend out there and that friend was Messenger Kid.
Messenger Kid was mute but like they say actions speak louder than words. You'll just have to imagine the hijinks and shenanigans. Or read my other book. Anyway Messenger Kid was the kind of friend who'd risk everything for you and not think anything of it. He saved my butt on more than one occasion.
"You came here for my help?" I asked Dorktown.
"I thought we had to get nice guy Bruce to swap timelines with bad guy Mohawk Asshole to bring him back from Tomorrowland."
"Bruce is Mohawk Asshole."
"Right. So I'm gonna go kill Bruce. With or without you."
"James Bond once said 'Before setting out on revenge you first dig two graves.'"
"I'll dig as many graves as it takes" she said. "Are you gonna help me or not?"
"I had a chance to kill him once."
"Page 129. Why didn't you?"
I couldn't think of any more cool James Bond quotes so I let her go. She whipped her head around and vanished into the darkness.
I ran back to my trailer to grab my axe. Then I headed for the Cage. Or what used to be the Cage. It was now a heap of wood and metal and flames. I found my carnival barker and asked him what was up.
"The Helly killed the Gilly president" he explained. "The Gillies went berserk and the whole thing fell down. Everybody was kung fu fighting. I think we just started a civil war."
The Cage was a total loss so I headed back to my trailer. But closing in on my left and right were two gangs of monsters dressed as squares. The Hamburglar led the group on the left. The police officer led the group on the right. There were secretaries with torches and farmers with pitchforks and yodelers with nunchucks.
It was late but even the sleeping tomorrowlanders heard the ruckus and peeked out of their camps to see what was going on. Hundreds of them woke up and joined the mob.
"Death to Gillies!" one side chanted.
"Kill all Hellies" the other side replied.
I tightened my grip on the axe and took off running down the middle of the nightmare gauntlet.
The two fronts went to war and I was stuck in the middle. I got down on my hands and knees and crawled.
"Pardon me. Coming through" I said.
A severed ear landed on the ground in front of me. I stood up and looked around. It took a moment but I found the bloke it belonged to. I handed it back to him. He thanked me and shook my hand.
I got back down on the ground to crawl some more but as soon as I got down there I found a severed nose. I stood up again and found its owner. That guy also thanked me and shook my hand.
I got back to my crawling but yeah you guessed it something else fell off of someone. This time it was a hand. When I found the guy he tried to thank me but there was no point in shaking his hand cuz I was already shaking it.
As soon as I was out of the fray of foolishness I got up and took off running. Someone shouted "There he is! The guy who saved the Helly president!"
I ran to my trailer but when I got there it was in flames. The fireman was lobbing molotovs at it. My entire inventory of Firebuddies was burning along with the one that I used every day.
I went around back and hopped into my Pinto Cruising Wagon. 171 cubic inch V6. The thing looked like sex on wheels but drove like a moose on rollerskates. Silver with yellow and orange and purple stripes. The paint was perfect cuz no one had the knackers to smash into it. As you might recall Ford Pintos were famous for exploding on impact. Maybe it was just media hype but it kept the road warriors at bay.
I tried to get the Pinto started. I say tried cuz this car was no Firebird. It had one third the torque. It had one third the horsepower. And it took three times as long to start.
The angry tomorrowlanders heard me cranking the Pinto. They came running around back and surrounded the car.
An astronaut used their helmet to headbutt the side glass. The welldressed bloke who'd tried to sell me an insurance policy climbed onto the bonnet and banged his briefcase on the windscreen. The fireman lobbed a molotov and set the Pinto on fire. I was concerned it might explode but as you can see this page has more words on it so obviously that didn't happen at this point.
The engine finally turned over on its own power. I floored it and managed to shake off the insurance guy.
Tomorrowlanders were running in every direction. I headed for the main gate. My brand new Tomorrowland Weekend sign was on fire. A group of revolutionary librarians was rocking it back and forth trying to pull it down.
The movie star was arguing with Ulfsbane at the gate. Then a scary looking deep sea diver in one of those old hard shelled diving suits grabbed the Six Million Dollar Man lunchbox with my money in it and hobbled away. Ulfsbane noticed and went after him but the movie star tripped him and he went down.
As I neared the gate the scaffolding that was holding up the sign finally started tipping over. I gave the Pinto the bejeezus but it bogged down. Yeah that darned car actually slowed down when you stepped on the throttle. I just could not get that carburetor adjusted right. I lifted up on the pedal and barely made it through the gate in time to look in the mirror and see my beautiful new sign smash to the ground. A few burning boards bounced off the roof of the Pinto but it still did not explode.
I stopped the car and got out. I had put everything into this event. Now the whole thing was up in flames. I had created something to make people happy and give them hope but they had burned it all down. I guess I should have bought that insurance policy.
I heard someone to my left kickstarting a motorbike.
I heard someone to my right calling for help.
I looked to my left. The deep sea diver with my lunchbox full of coins was about to escape on a Honda CR250M Elsinore.
I looked to my right. Dorktown was trapped under the burning Tomorrowland Weekend sign.
I looked left again. I looked right again.
Dagnabbit.
The deep sea diver rode off on his motorbike as I chopped away at the burning sign with my axe.CHAPTER 2: bakersfield
Before we left I promised my employees there would be jobs waiting for them in Norwood if we got the factory up and running. Then I borrowed Dorktown's Firebuddy to send a message to someone who might help us.
He didn't just borrow it. He's writing this whole damn book on my Firebuddy. That means I can help write it!!
Stop it Dorktown.
The next morning we stopped at the Woolworth's diner in Bakersfield. We sat down and ordered bacon and eggs and chocolate malts.
"What are we sitting around for?" Dorktown asked. "Mohawk Asshole could be in Norwood by now."
"Do you know where Norwood is?"
I looked toward the entrance and Dorktown followed my gaze.
"Oh my god!" Dorktown said. "Is that her?" She got up and ran to the door.
"Are you Mad Skelli?" she asked. "Can I have your autograph?"
Mad Skelli had indeed joined us for breakfast. Mad Skelli was my girlfriend back in Australia. Here in the USA I was still trying to figure out what she was. One thing I knew for sure was that she was my biggest competitor. She sold computers known as DingoDongles. Skelli sat down and signed Dorktown's book.
"Isn't she a bit young for you?" Skelli asked.
"She's not my girlfriend" I said.
"I'm his mission partner" Dorktown said.
"She's the president of my fan club" I said.
"And its only member" Skelli said. "What do you want?"
"I need to borrow some money" I said.
"You're the world's first postapocalyptic millionaire. Why do you need to borrow money from me?"
"You're the world's second postapocalyptic millionaire. Who else am I gonna borrow it from?"
"What do you need it for?"
"Tomorrowland Weekend went up in flames."
"Fuck Tomorrowland Weekend" Dorktown said. "Mohawk Asshole killed my pop. My pop was a friend of yours you called Messenger Kid."
Skelli looked at Dorktown. "Mohawk Asshole killed Messenger Kid?"
"Yeah."
"You're Messenger Kid's... kid?"
"Yeah. And we're gonna kill Mohawk Asshole."
"She's gonna kill Mohawk Asshole" I said. "I'm gonna recommission an old Firebird factory and build some new Firebirds."
Dorktown turned to me. "Do you know why Mohawk Asshole killed my pop?"
I thought about it for a moment. Then I looked down at the table.
"He was looking for you" Dorktown said.
When I got on a boat and returned to the USA thirteen years ago I left Skelli and Messenger Kid behind. They were the only people who knew where I was. Skelli came to join me later but we never heard from Messenger Kid again.
"What do you need?" Skelli asked.
"Money to get to Norwood" Dorktown said. "And weapons we can use to capture Mohawk Asshole."
"And money to reopen the factory" I added.
"I'll give you the money to get to Norwood" Skelli said to Dorktown. "You'll have to figure out weapons."
"And the Firebird factory?" I asked.
"Chew on me bloody minge" Skelli replied.
"I thought you two were in love" Dorktown said.
Skelli turned to Dorktown. "First you said you were gonna kill him. Then you said you were gonna capture him. Which is it?"
"First the second. Then the first. We're gonna capture him and then we're gonna throw him out of a helicopter."
That was oddly specific and vaguely disturbing. "A helicopter?" I asked.
Dorktown nodded.
"Do you have a helicopter?"
"We'll have to borrow one."
"Do you know how to fly a helicopter?"
"I read a book about it."
"Have you ever killed anyone?" Skelli asked her.
"No but I've practiced bashing in the skulls of dead kangaroos."
"Cracking skulls ain't all it's cracked up to be" Skelli said.
"You killed Fake Cop." Dorktown was referring to Skelli's ex who was also Mohawk Asshole's best mate.
"I did it to save a life" Skelli said. "Not for revenge."
A man came to the table and asked if we were enjoying the food.
"Yes!" Dorktown exclaimed. "Are you the owner? I wanna ask you something." She got up and walked with him to the cash register. She touched his arm and giggled.
"Sweet kid" Skelli said.
"She's a psychopath" I replied.
Dorktown pointed at an old Barnett Wildcat crossbow that was hanging on the wall. The shop owner took it down and handed it to her. Then he reached under the counter and handed her a single arrow or "bolt" as they refer to them in crossbowland.
"I thought she didn't have any money" Skelli said.
"She doesn't."
Skelli grudgingly paid for our meal and we went outside. She used her DingoDongle to transfer some Firebucks to Dorktown and handed her a big sack of coins. They exchanged a few words I couldn't hear. Then Skelli skedattled.
Firebird forgot to mention that Skelli gave him a kiss goodbye. They're in love!!
Dammit Dorktown. If you're gonna chime in at least give us some useful information. What did Skelli whisper to you?
She said "If you fuck him I'll smash your pretty little toes with a hammer."
Skelli definitely did not say that.
Dorktown put her new crossbow in the back seat of the Pinto.
"Can I drive?" Dorktown asked.
"Nobody drives my car" I said as we got in.
"Norwood?" she asked.
"Van Nuys" I said.CHAPTER 3: VAN NUYS
Not many people have written books in the past 38 years. So nowadays every book that gets written sort of has to be a history book and a philosophy book and a survival book too. So I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't tell you what I know about how things got to be the way they are and offer some ideas about how to get things back to the way they were.
I hope you're gonna spew on about economics again. That was my favourite part of the last book!!
You're being sarcastic aren't you Dorktown. Listen. Economics is more than just the study of how people spend money. It's the study of how we make choices. The choices we make could change our lives and the lives of those around us. The choices we make could even save the world. So economics is the study of how to save the world. Stop fucking up my our!! story.
I'm We're!! writing this book in what we call the Year 38. The reason we call it Year 38 is cuz the Big Bang happened 38 years ago. That was Year Zero.
The world used to be a much swankier place. I'm a prewar so I should know. I was there. Mohawk Asshole was there too. Skelli and Dorktown weren't there. They were postwars.
The Big Bang wasn't just a war. There were diseases and pests and natural disasters and unnatural disasters too. By the time it was over the governments of the world had all bombed themselves out of existence and taken 95% of humanity with them.
Imagine you're one of the survivors. Imagine you work in the Norwood assembly plant building Trans Ams. If you showed up for work and 95% of your coworkers were gone could you keep building cars? No way. That's why no one's built a new car in 38 years.
But now imagine you're working on your car in your garage and you need an alternator. 95% of the cars in your neighborhood don't have owners anymore. Why steal when you can scavenge? Why fight when you can buy and sell and barter?
The Big Bang took away everything it could take. But it couldn't take away our grit or guff or gumption or good old-fashioned American ingenuity. Yeah people are ingenious all over the world but back in the old days everyone came to America to be ingenious. The USA was the most prosperous country in history.
The human brain has a thing called negativity bias. We focus on the bad stuff to ensure that threats don't get the better of us. So it was easy for people like Howard Zinn to catalog all the things that the USA got wrong. Yeah I read that book and yeah I get it.
But I'll bet you a hundred bucks you don't know who Norman Borlaug was. Norman Borlaug saved a billion lives by inventing new strains of wheat that ended up feeding the entire planet. If positivity bias were a thing we'd all be wearing tshirts with Norman Borlaug's face on them.
Negativity bias makes us take the good stuff for granted. So  when we look back on the USA's history it's easy to figure out what we did wrong but what's not so easy is figuring out what exactly we did right.
Hell if I know what it was. I'm just gonna do the best I can. Yeah Tomorrowland Weekend was fake. But I really am trying to rebuild the world. I'm gonna give people the real Tomorrowland. Everything we used to have and more. The computers I'm selling are only the beginning. One day those computers are gonna fit in your pocket. We'll have skyscrapers and jets and satellites again. We'll have space stations. And cities on the moon.
I may be a moneygrubbing capitalist pig but I got dreams too. Who says you have to suffer and sacrifice to save the world? If I can save the world and make money doing it then everybody wins.
I invented the Firebuddy. I made money digital. I brought back TV and movies. You can read all about it in that other book if you want.
Next I'm gonna bring back cars. Shiny fucking Trans Ams with big fucking birds painted on the bonnets. Don't even try to pretend like you don't want one.
I do want one!! Hot pink with an orange bird. But can we get back to the fighting and killing now??
Fine.
"Van Nuys?" Dorktown asked. "What the fuck? We have to get to Norwood."
"Pontiac Firebirds were assembled in two locations" I said. "Norwood Ohio and Van Nuys California. Van Nuys is a suburb of Las Diablas. It's only two hours away. If Mohawk Asshole has half a brain he'll be headed there first."
"How much of a brain does he have?"
"He's not as dumb as he looks. And sounds. And thinks. And acts."
Dorktown got out her book again and started flipping through it.
"What are you doing?"
"If we've got two hours then I've got some more questions."
"Ok shoot."
"Did Skelli know all along that Tomorrowland wasn't real?"
"She never even heard of Tomorrowland until my book came out."
"What about that scene where she witnessed you swapping timelines with John?"
"I made that up."
She laughed. "You're an asshole."
"I'm a storyteller."
"No you're not. I know for a fact that half your book is true. I just don't know which half. Like at the end of the book you were held at gunpoint by the woman with the paperclip necklace who blamed you for her husband's death. She was gonna kill you. But you're still here. How did you escape?"
"I grabbed her gun and shot her."
"Did you ever really find out what was on the movie film in your parents' safe?"
"No but my mom really sang that song to me as a lullaby. I'll never forget it. Close To You by The Carpenters."
I pulled off at an old servo in Castaic that looked like it might still be in business. The joint was called Gallion's Corner. "We gotta get some petrol."
"No wait! I'm not done! Was it you that took Deadline to Uranium Springs?"
I winked at her. Then I got out of the car and went in to look for signs of life.
Dorktown found my JVC RCM90 cassette player and Koss PRO4A headphones in the back seat and tried them out.
I found a bloke inside who had some petrol for sale. "Fill her up. She's paying" I said. "Where's the dunny?"
"Huh?"
"The restroom?"
"Around the side."
I headed around the building and tugged on the door. Locked.
"Just a minute" a muffled voice said.
I paced around for a moment before I noticed the front wheel and fender of a motorbike peeking around from behind the building. I could recognize that bike from a hundred meters away. Honda CR250M Elsinore. It was the deep sea diver's bike.
The toilet flushed.
I found an old rusty modular shelving unit and pushed it up against the restroom door.
"Dorktown!" I shouted.
No response.
"Dorktown!"
Nothing.
I ran around front while the diver struggled to push his way out of the restroom. Dorktown was still listening to music. I snatched the headphones off of her.
"What the fuck?" she asked.
"It's him!"
"Mohawk Asshole?" She got out and went for her crossbow.
"No. The asshole who stole my Six Million Dollar Man lunchbox!"
"Lunchbox? Jesus fuck. I'll buy you another lunch."
"No my lunchbox full of money!" I tried to grab her crossbow but she held on tight.
"You have a gun. Go shoot him with it."
He'd almost bashed his way out of the restroom. I ran back to the door and held it in place. I pulled out my Liberator and twisted the cocking knob into place. I pointed it into the doorway.
"Give me back my lunchbox you chum dumpster!" I yelled.
Wait that's a good one. He just earned himself a nickname.
Chumdumpster braced himself against the opposite wall and kicked the door as hard as he could. The shelving unit fell over with me under it.
He pushed his way out of the restroom. He had my lunchbox in his hand. He climbed on top of the shelving unit and trapped me under it.
I couldn't breathe.
"Dorktown" I gasped.
I could see his face laughing through the thick glass of  his helmet.
"Help" I whispered.
I stuck my gun against his metal suit and pulled the trigger. The Liberator's spot welds all blew out and the gun cracked itself in half in my hand. I have no idea where the bullet went but it sure as hell didn't go into Chumdumpster.
He got up and tottered over to his bike. He walked right by my face. I got a good look at his feet. He had on a pair of red Chuck Taylors. I guess he couldn't find a pair of metal shoes to match the rest of his outfit.
Chumdumpster put my lunchbox into his saddlebag and came back with a rope. He tied one end of the rope to my foot. He tied the other end to his bike. He got on and started it up.
He pulled away slowly to tighten up the slack. He stopped and turned to look at me. Then he revved the engine and pulled away hard.
He yanked me out from under the shelves and dragged me across the bitumen. The bike turned onto the road and picked up speed.
I did my best to curl into a ball and sit up so I could get my hands on the rope around my foot. I couldn't untie it. The knot got tighter and tighter as he dragged me. But I did manage to grab the rope and pull myself forward so it wasn't pulling on my leg so hard.
Then I positioned the edge of my foot on the top of the rope so the rope was being crushed between my foot and the road. The rope started smoking.
I lost a layer of denim and a few layers of skin but finally the rope snapped. I slid into a ditch and Chumdumpster rode off.
I limped back to the servo with blood all over me.
Dorktown looked up and took off the headphones.
"How'd you do?" she asked.
"Why didn't you come after us?"
"He's not part of the mission" she said.
"He's part of the mission now."
"You told me never to drive your car."
"New rule. You can drive my car if it's an emergency."
"Me drive Pinto! Me drive Pinto!"
"Only in an emergency. And there aren't going to be any more emergencies."
I got in the car and started it up. Then I remembered something. I turned to face her.
"If you do drive the car don't run into anything."
"Why not?"
"Pintos are famous for exploding. Ok?"
"Exploding car. Got it."
"What are you listening to?" I asked.
She grabbed the cassette box. It was a mixtape of bootlegs my dad had made for me when I was a kid. "The Rolling Stones" she said. "Shattered. Live in Fort Worth 1978."
"I hear Keith Richards is still alive."
"Who's Keith Richards?" she asked.
When we arrived in Van Nuys we found some vendors setting up a flea market in a vacant lot. We stopped to check out the wares and see if we could get any information about the factory.
One old man had heaps of carburetors in several shopping trolleys. I introduced myself.
"G'day. I'm Firebird. This is Dorktown."
"Tex Phoenix" he said.
"Nice to meet you Tex Phoenix. You got a carb that will fit on my V6?"
"This ain't much of a Ford town. But I got one that might do the trick."
While he was digging up the carburetor I grabbed two ancient pieces of grape Bubble Yum from my stash and tossed one to Dorktown. She unwrapped it and put it in her mouth. Her eyes lit up in delight.
Tex showed me the carb. It had clearly been rebuilt with care. Clean as a whistle. New handcut gaskets and everything.
"Did you rebuild this?" I asked.
"Yessirree."
"Looks great. Mind if I try it out?"
"Go right ahead."
I got to work putting it on. "How long have you been doing this kind of thing?"
"I've been building engines for dang near fifty years. I worked at the GM plant. We all did." He gestured at the others.
"We're headed to the plant now" I said. "Can you give us directions?"
"It's just a few blocks thattaway. But you don't want to go there now."
"What do you mean?"
"We were selling old parts out of the place. I'd even put together a nice turbo V8. Yesterday some fopdoodle with a mohawk showed up acting like he owned the joint. Then some gollumpus in an old timey dive suit joined him. They took my V8 and kicked us out of the place."
"Why'd they kick you out?"
"They wanted us to help them make new cars. We asked how much they were gonna pay us. They said we wouldn't get a paycheck but we'd all split up the profits. If there were any profits. None of us wanted to take that risk so we told them to go suck eggs."
This wasn't the first time Mohawk Asshole had done shit like this. Last year he raided and took over my old Firebuddy factory. My new factory in Arizona was well hidden for just this reason.
"I wanna build cars there too" I explained. "I'll have jobs for all of you if you want them. Jobs with real paychecks. If not here then in Norwood."
Several of the other workers overheard our conversation and joined us. They were clearly interested in the idea of reopening the plant but they had questions.
One of the workers spoke up for the group. "We're getting older" she said. "Some of us can't do the same jobs we used to."
"You'll be the managers" I said. "The trainers. The designers. We'll hire new people to do the heavy lifting."
"Who gets the profits?" the same worker asked.
"I'll keep the profits. If there are any profits."
"What if we want a share of the profits and a paycheck too?" I was already starting to feel like I was dealing with the union's new boss.
"I'll give you a share of the profits but the paycheck will be smaller" I offered.
The group mulled over the idea for a moment.
"We don't like that idea" she said.
"I don't like it either" I said. "That's how we know we've got a deal." I held out my hand to her.
She talked with her compatriots for a moment. Then she turned to me and shook my hand.
The workers dispersed while muttering excitedly. One of workers ran back to his flea market stall and jumped on his CB radio to broadcast the news about the possibility of the factory reopening.
Let me explain something to you postwars out there. Back in the 70s everyone suddenly realized how cool truckers were. And those truckers all had CB radios. So in the 70s everyone bought CB radios in order to try to make themselves as cool as the truckers. My parents even had one in their station wagon. After the Big Bang a lot of people still had those CB radios lying around. That's why they're still used so much. Now that we got Firebuddies and other types of computers people can communicate that way too but since computer networks are so unreliable the CB radio is still one of the best ways to keep in touch.
"Are there enough parts left in the place to build any cars?" I asked Tex.
"There are some motors and subframes sitting around" he said. "Plenty of Camaro body panels but they're pretty rusty. Not a shard of glass left in the place. Not enough parts to make a complete car. But you could probably get some kind of frankencar up and running."
I put the air cleaner back onto the carb. I started up the Pinto and revved it up. "Carb sounds great. What do I owe you?"
"Put it in my first paycheck" Tex said. "If you survive."
"Survive?" I asked.
"They've got a whole army in that place now. And they've set up a guillotine out front."
"A guillotine?"
"Yep. They said they'd cut off our heads if we didn't leave town."
"Are you gonna leave?" I asked.
"We ain't going nowhere" he said.
"We'll survive" Dorktown said. She held up her crossbow and spoke while smacking her gum. "We're gonna fix the world and kill the assholes that broke it."
"That's my girl" I said.
She smiled and swallowed her gum.
"There are two guards out front by the guillotine" Tex explained. "But you don't have to go in the front."
He reached into his pocket and handed me a single key on an old GM keychain. "This key opens the fire exit on the east side of the main building."
"We'll go in tonight" I said.
A deuce-and-a-half drove by us headed toward the plant. Its occupants were all wearing blonde wigs. They eyed us suspiciously. We eyed them confusedly.
"We need somewhere to hole up" I said.
"If you head southeast to Burbank there's a little place called the Safari Inn."
Me and Dorktown got back into the Pinto and headed over to Burbank. We got a room at the inn. The sky had yellow and orange and purple stripes going all the way across it.
The motel pools are all empty nowadays so I grabbed my skateboard and went to check it out.
I set my board on the coping and dropped in. I immediately slammed in a puddle of muck.
I heard Dorktown laughing at me. I looked up and saw her sitting on the edge of the pool with her legs dangling.
I was in me undies.
Yes you were. But I don't want them to think of you that way.
I don't mind.
Yes but you have more to offer than that. And that's not what this story is about.
Anyway Dorktown had my tape player with her. She pressed play. Bruce Springsteen. Rosalita Come Out Tonight. Live in Phoenix 1978. Four different women stormed the stage that night.
I dropped into the pool again. I pulled off a few ollies below the coping and even a little grind. I always skate better when I have someone to show off for.
I climbed out of the pool and grabbed a couple more pieces of Bubble Yum. We popped them in our mouths but Dorktown swallowed hers again after chewing for just a minute.
"That's not how you do it. Watch."
I blew a bubble as big as Dorktown's head. Her eyes widened in amazement and she smiled. But this time it wasn't the same smile she used when she wanted to get something from you. This one was real and radiant and I never wanted to see it end.
"Let me try let me try!" she said.
I gave her my gum. She chewed it a bit. Then she tried to blow a bubble but she just spat the gum into my face.
In my last book I'd written about how we'd witnessed Mohawk Asshole falling asleep at the wheel at 3am. So when we went back to the hotel room I set the alarm for 2:30am. Dorktown promptly fell asleep but I did not.
I stood by the window and looked at the stars. I couldn't stop thinking about what I had to do. I knew it wasn't gonna be good. I checked my pocket to make sure I had my handcuffs and checked my keyring to make sure I had the key.
When the alarm went off I grabbed the axe. "It's time" I said.
Dorktown yawned. "Let's go do some murdering."
The Pinto crept toward the plant. I kept the headlights off. We parked a block away.
I noticed that Firebird was wearing a watch so I asked him what time it was.
"I dunno" he said. "It's broken."
Then I realised he was still wearing the broken watch his dad had given him 38 years ago. In his last book he'd claimed that he'd thrown it away.
I don't see how that's relevant.
You're a goddamn softcock and you're about to prove it.
Ok well let me finish telling them what happened and we'll let them decide.
I pulled the cuffs out of my pocket. I slapped one of them onto the steering wheel.
"What are those for?" Dorktown asked.
I grabbed her hand and slapped the other cuff onto her wrist.
Asshole.
"What are you doing?" she cried.
"This isn't who you are" I said.
"You don't know who I am!"
"This isn't who I want you to be."
I got out and grabbed the axe. Dorktown freaked out and tugged at the steering wheel furiously to no avail. I headed for the assembly plant.
The facility was massive and made up of several buildings. It was painful to see that what had once been a shining bastion of progress and prosperity was now reduced to a ghostly collection of blackened husks.
Light was coming from an open garage bay door on the main building. Silhouetted in front of the door was an actual goddamn guillotine just like Tex said. The guillotine was being watched by two guards who were wearing long blonde wigs. Parked out front was the deuce-and-a-half we'd seen earlier and a sand rail in addition to the Elsinore motorbike.
I went around back and used Tex's key to sneak in through the darkened fire door.
I had some trouble pushing the door open cuz something was leaning up against it. I squeezed my way in but in doing so I knocked over a pile of something.
I was greeted by Tex's mutilated head on a pike just inches away from my face.
There were a dozen other heads on a dozen other pikes too. It was all the plant workers who had refused to leave town.
If you came here to read about grisly murder well then there you go. But before you start wanking off to it I got some shit I wanna say.
They named the guillotine after a bloke named Guillotin. He was wholeheartedly against killing people. He was horrified when he found out what he would be forever remembered for. He never even built a guillotine. He just came up with the idea as a way to improve upon the long and agonizing spectacles that public executions had become. The guillotine was the quickest and most humane manner of inducing death anyone could come up with at the time. He hoped that performing executions in this abrupt and boring way would discourage the crowds of gawkers from showing up.
It didn't work. People were more excited than ever to watch others lose their lives. Children sang guillotine songs and played guillotine games. Artists made guillotine art. Families used miniature novelty guillotines to slice vegetables. Jokes were made and idioms were born. Like the phrase "Heads will roll."
Doctors performed experiments on the heads. They'd talk to them and slap them and give them instructions to respond to in order to see how long the heads would stay alive. The answer is somewhere between three and thirty seconds. Either end of that range sounds like way too long to me.
The Nazis were some of the biggest users of the guillotine. The last legal guillotine execution happened in 1977. Just as society was about to cease this savagery the Big Bang destroyed society and the savagery began all over again.
I'd much rather drop someone out of a helicopter.
Why do you keep bringing up helicopters? You're missing the point. Killing is sometimes necessary but it's something you should avoid at all costs. If you're gonna kill someone it should only be to stop them from killing you or someone else. Life is the best thing that's ever happened to any wad of atoms in this whole entire universe and we should appreciate it.
It was probably not the best time for me to be thinking about this cuz at that very moment I was carrying an axe down a hallway so I could take the life of another human being. But I'd had 38 years to prepare for this and new stuff had come to light since the last time I'd had him in my sights. I'd shown him mercy that day. Like Dorktown said. Page 129. But not this time. Never again.
I was in a dark hallway with several entrances to dark offices. I could see a dim light coming from around a corner up ahead. I rounded the corner and at the end of the hallway there was a door with a window in it. It led to the main floor. Framed right in center of that window was a Chevy Trans Am Pontiac Camaro frankencar they'd hacked together. I'll call it the Frankenbird.
I must admit it was quite majestic in its way. The Frankenbird wasn't a Trans Am and it wasn't a Camaro but it was clearly made up of bits of both. The nose was from an '81 Firebird but the tail was from a Camaro. Side pipes with no heat shields. Gratings were welded on in the places where windows were supposed to be. It had a twotone paint job. The two tones were rust and primer. On the bonnet where the firebird logo was supposed to go they'd painted a bird's skeleton.
Tex's handbuilt engine was jutting out of the bonnet but they'd piled dual stacked superchargers on top of it. Dual stacked superchargers on a turbocharged 4.9L V8. There was no way that engine could take all that fuel and air. I'd be surprised if they could even get it started. It looked like something I would have drawn in grade school which is to say it looked awesome and scary as hell.
A mechanic in a blonde wig was working late putting the finishing touches on the abomination. He kept trying to start it up but he wasn't having any luck.
Then I heard someone snore loudly in the darkened office right beside me.
I froze for a moment. I waited for another snore then snuck in.
Someone was sleeping on a mattress in the center of the office. I inched closer. It was him. Mohawk Asshole. Still in his tuxedo.
He'd killed my family. He'd killed Messenger Kid. Who knows how many others had died because of him? It was time to put an end to this.
Damn right it was.
I lifted the axe and aimed for his neck.
Did you hesitate?
I did not hesitate.
You fucking hesitated. And I know why. Laura told me.
They don't know who Laura is yet. You're getting ahead of the story. And this is kind of a pivotal moment.
At this point five major events happened in quick succession.
1. The Frankenbird's engine cranked over a few more times but this time rather than coughing and sputtering it finally fired up. The entire building started rumbling.
2. Mohawk Asshole woke up with a start. He gave me a funny look.
3. The head fell off of my axe.
4. The butt of the axe head hit Mohawk Asshole in the forehead. It bounced to the floor.
5. A voice arose from a dark corner of the room and said "Dad?" I looked up. It was Chumdumpster. He was still in the dive suit. He must sleep in that thing.
This was a lot to take in. It would have been nice if the axe head had knocked Mohawk Asshole unconscious but instead it had imbued him with a new and more extreme form of consciousness.
He got up. I started thwacking him with the axe handle. It was the best I could do. We're all just doing the best we can right?
He took the axe handle from me. He threw it across the room.
A light came on in the hallway. There were more people in these offices and they were now awake.
I bolted out of the room and slammed the door. I held it shut. Mohawk Asshole and Chumdumpster were tugging on the knob. They were a couple of knobtuggers.
Knobtuggers. I gotta remember that one.
Ten assholes in stairstep camo fatigues came around the corner and stopped when they saw me. Every one of them had an AK47 that was clean and shiny which suggested to me it was probably also in good working order. And no matter what their gender or race or age every one of them had on a long blonde wig. I shall dub them the Flirty Dozen.
I let go of the office door and kicked it in so it would knock over Asshole and Asshole Jr. I ran out the door that led to the main factory floor.
I looked at the Frankenbird. It was idling fifty metres away. I didn't have a chance of making it. But if I surrendered I'd just end up spending thirty seconds lying on the ground looking up at the sky and thinking how much it sucks to not have a body anymore.
Bullets shattered the window beside me.
I took off running for the Frankenbird. The door flew open and every one of those clean and shiny AK47s started going off while pointed in my general direction.
The mechanic stared at the Frankenbird's idling engine looking confused. He thought the gunshots were backfires.
Then there was the sound of another car approaching and a smash. One of the Flirty Dozen shouted "Hold your fire! It's a Pinto! Take cover!"
Dorktown was driving the Pinto while handcuffed to the wheel. She'd driven right into the guillotine smashing it into splinters and continued through the garage bay door. The Pinto's paint was perfect no more. It didn't have headlights anymore either.
She tried to run over Mohawk Asshole and Chumdumpster and the Flirty Dozen but they all ran out of her way.
I'll forgive her for driving my car. This was an emergency and she was coming to my rescue.
No I wasn't. I was pissed off. I came to blow everything up with your exploding car.
I'm glad the car didn't explode.
Thanks to Dorktown's distraction I made it to the Frankenbird. I slammed the bonnet down on the mechanic's head and pushed him out of the way. I hopped in and kicked it in the guts. We flogged it out of there and began the race for Norwood.CHAPTER 4: seligman
We headed out of Las Diablas on what was left of Route 66. Mohawk Asshole took off after us in the sand rail. Chumdumpster was still riding the Elsinore. The Flirty Dozen piled into the deuce-and-a-half.
The sand rail and the Elsinore didn't have headlights so they had to stay behind the deuce. The Pinto didn't have headlights either after smashing into the guillotine so Dorktown had to stay behind me. But the Pinto had a new carb and the Frankenbird had a toey V8 so it didn't take long to put some distance between us and the assholes.
We stayed off the highways to avoid the robbers who would be blocking the roads and charging tolls. And don't tell me we should just pay the toll. Sometimes the toll was something more than money. Especially for someone like Dorktown. That was a toll we were not gonna pay.
We needed petrol so we stopped at Roy's Cafe in Amboy just as the sun was coming up.
"Let me out of these cuffs" Dorktown demanded from the driver's seat of the Pinto. She did not look at me when she spoke.
"Will you fill up my tank?" I asked.
"Let me out of these cuffs" she repeated.
"Will you at least promise not to go on a murderous rampage?"
"Murderous rampage is the reason I'm here. Let me out of these bloody cuffs!" she screamed.
The owner was standing by the front door. I dunno if his name was really Roy but that's what I'm calling him. Roy said "If you two ain't buying no gas you'd best be on your way."
I took the cuffs off.
"What the fuck happened?" Dorktown asked.
"Mohawk Asshole and Chumdumpster and the Flirty Dozen are all gonna be here any minute. They want the Frankenbird back. They wanna get to Norwood before we do. And they wanna cut off our heads. We gotta get some petrol right now."
Dorktown turned to Roy. "Fill up both cars." Then she turned back to me. "What the fuck happened?"
"Tex and the other factory workers are all dead."
"And Mohawk Asshole isn't."
"Mohawk Asshole had a goddamn army with him" I explained.
"Of course he had an army" she said casually. "He's the president of the Gillies."
"I thought the president of the Gillies was killed in The Cage."
"He was. Mohawk Asshole was the vice president."
"What's a Gilly?"
"A Gilly is someone who cuts the heads off of Hellies."
"What's a Helly?"
"A Helly is someone who drops Gillies out of helicopters."
"What is it with you and helicopters?"
"It's how Hellies kill people. Drop the bad guys out of helicopters. Like Pinochet used to do."
Oh now I get it.
Pinochet was a Chilean dictator propped up by the US government. I know a lot about him cuz my mom worked with him back in the 70s. Mom was an economist. By following my mother's advice Pinochet saved Chile's economy. But he was a murderous monster who killed thousands of people. And yeah he was famous for dropping people out of helicopters.
Pinochet was a fascist capitalist. Capitalism is supposed to be about freedom. Laissez faire literally just means letting people do their thing. Pinochet thought he could force people to be free. But dropping people out of helicopters was not letting people do their thing. He ruined the reputation of capitalism for generations to come. Pinochet was no hero. His was not an example to be emulated.
"Are you saying you're a Helly?" I asked.
"Of course I'm a Helly" Dorktown replied. "I thought you were too."
"No fucking way. The only thing I know for sure about Hellies and Gillies is I am neither one of those things."
"You have to be one or the other" she said. "Only evil stands to benefit from a compromise. It's like mixing water with poison."
I rested my face on my palm. "If all you have is a line defined by two points then yeah maybe you have to pick one side or the other. But there are other dimensions. Three points and you have a triangle. Four points and you have a tetrahedron. My ideas are three dimensional."
"Whatever. It was your book that got me interested in politics in the first place."
"I don't write about politics. I write about economics."
"What's the difference?" she asked.
"Economics is the science of proving politics shouldn't exist. Politics is the art of pretending economics doesn't exist."
Dorktown rolled her eyes. "Are we gonna assassinate this asshole or what?" she asked.
"We're not assassinating anyone" I said.
"What do you mean?"
"This isn't political."
"If you kill a president it's gonna be political."
Ok she had a point there. "There's something else" I said. "Chumdumpster is Mohawk Asshole's son."
"I'm Messenger Kid's daughter."
I noticed headlights approaching from the west. I turned to Roy. "Listen we're in a bit of a hurry."
"I'm squeezing this here handle as hard as I can" Roy said. "You're welcome to pay me now if you wanna get out of here quicker."
I looked at Dorktown. She got out her Firebuddy and send the bloke some Firebucks.
"Oh wow" she said.
"What?"
"You got a befriending request from Count Bartholomu Bubury. He says thanks for saving his life."
"The president of the Hellies? Tell him to go throw himself out of a helicopter. Are you ok to drive?"
"We'll sleep when Mohawk Asshole is dead. Where to?"
"My Firebuddy factory in Seligman. I have weapons there. Keep your speed up so they don't follow us in. Mohawk Asshole doesn't know the location of the new factory and I wanna keep it that way."
Mohawk Asshole orchestrated a hostile takeover of my previous factory and used it to make and sell ripoff Firebuddies I refer to as Assholebuddies. I've seen several Assholebuddies around but I've never seen one that actually worked.
The headlights were getting closer. Roy finished fueling us up and we took off. But as soon as we got started the Pinto was dragging its feet again.
I pulled over and got out.
"What's wrong?" I asked.
"I dunno" Dorktown said. "I'm stomping on the pedal and nothing's happening."
"Ok if the assholes start to catch up then pull over. I'll turn around and pick you up and we'll leave the Pinto behind."
The Pinto took its sweet time but we finally made it to Seligman. I headed for the old airport and Dorktown followed. I pulled off to a big vacant space beside the crumbling runway. Or at least I had made sure that it looked vacant. Me and Dorktown stopped and got out of our cars.
"Where are we?" she asked.
"My Firebuddy factory" I said with arms outstretched.
I pulled out a remote control and pressed a button. A massive hinged door slowly lifted up off the ground in front of us revealing a ramp leading down into my underground factory.
"We can drive the cars in" I said.
We brought the cars into the factory and I shut the main door. We moved the cassette player and the headphones and the rest of my stuff out of the Pinto and into the Frankenbird. My factory manager Laura greeted us as my technicians continued their work. I introduced Laura to Dorktown.
You skipped something.
What do you mean?
The Tim Tams.
Right. I noticed that Dorktown had eaten an old package of Tim Tams I'd left in the glovebox of the Pinto.
You were furious!!
I didn't say you could eat them.
You went to look for them and you freaked out when you found out they were gone. You took the empty wrapper out of the glovebox and saved it.
So what?
Something was special about those Tim Tams. I figured out what it was. They were the Tim Tams you bought for your sister 38 years ago. You said in your book that you ate them on the day she died. Page 6. Just like you said you chucked your dad's broken watch. Page 34. But you still had the watch. I bet you still have that Hot Wheels Trans Am too.
I do. It's a cool toy.
Your mother was holding it in her hand when Mohawk Asshole blew her to smithereens.
That's right Dorktown. Let's get back to the story.
I took Dorktown to the weapons room where we had five Martin Warthog compound bows and eight Ka-Bar knives stashed.
"These are the weapons we came here for?" Dorktown asked. "This isn't Sherwood Forest. Mohawk Asshole has guns."
"Next time I'll build a gun factory."
We cleaned out the weapons room and packed everything into the boot of the Frankenbird. Then I made the mistake of lying down on a couch Laura kept outside her office. I dozed off.
I talked to Laura while you were asleep.
She's not the only one you talked to.
Now who's getting ahead of the story??
You lied to me.
You lied to me too.
You're ruining the story.
The story sucks.
It's not just a story. It's life.
Life sucks.
You don't know how it ends yet.
Are you gonna tell them or should I??
Fine. You tell my story. I'll tell yours.
When you introduced me to Laura I immediately knew who she was. I recognised her necklace made out of paperclips. You described that necklace in your book. Laura's husband made it for her. Laura is the woman who blamed you for her husband's death. She had you at gunpoint. You told me you grabbed her gun and shot her. But she's alive. Not only that but you're friends. You work together.
I was trying to tell a good story.
You were trying to make us think you're someone you're not.
Ok. I didn't kill Laura. I didn't kill Mohawk Asshole. The truth is I've never killed anyone. Does that make me a bad person?
No it just makes you a bad killer.
You've never killed anyone either.
Yeah but when I do I promise you I'm gonna be really fucking good at it.
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
Oh I hope it does.
I apologize for the nonlinear narration style of my mission partner. I think it's safe to assume that what you'd like to hear about right now is the stuff that happened next. So that's what I'm gonna tell you.
We left the Pinto behind and took off in the Frankenbird. Dorktown was quiet. She typed on her Firebuddy the whole time. She didn't even notice when I stopped to check on a family in an overturned Volkswagen Beetle convertible. The family was all dead so we continued on our way. There was a burned up tanker truck on its side blocking the road a bit farther down. We had to drive through the dirt to get around it.
The next servo we found was the old Texaco station in Ash Fork so we pulled off there. Dorktown ran inside. I followed her. We sat down at the counter.
The owner of the place was a bit younger than me but probably still a prewar. He was adjusting the squelch on an old CB radio that was buzzing and chirping behind the counter. The CB mostly made static noises but every now and then it sounded like there might be a ghost of a human voice out there.
"You got any food here?" Dorktown asked the owner.
"Burgers and hot dogs" he said.
"I'll have 25 burgers for takeaway" she said.
"You hungry?" I asked.
I heard a helicopter approaching. I hadn't heard one of those in a long time. The servo owner filled up a sack with Dorktown's strangely large order of hamburgers.
Dorktown handed me her Firebuddy. "Shit's about to go down. You might wanna update your story."
"I thought it was our story."
Dorktown grabbed the sack of burgers and ran outside. I followed her out and looked up at the sky. The servo owner peeked out the window.
It was not just one helicopter. It was a dozen of them. These days seeing one working helicopter was a big deal. So seeing a dozen of them all at once was a deal that was a dozen times bigger. Most of them were military choppers which was even more surprising since there was no military anymore. Hueys. Loaches. Kiowas. And you won't believe what was bringing up the rear. It was the last of the ACH47A Chinooks. Nicknamed "Easy Money." They'd only made four of them and only one had made it back from Vietnam. These special Chinooks were known as "Guns-A-Go-Go" because they were loaded with .50 caliber machine guns and rockets and grenade launchers pointing in every direction. The thing was armored so it could take abuse as well as dish it out.
We stood by as all twelve of the helicopters landed on the main drag of Ash Fork. They kept the blades spinning. The roar of the engines was deafening. The downwash kicked dust into our eyes.
Dorktown turned to me. "Mohawk Asshole has an army" she said. "Now I have one too." She started handing out hamburgers to all the people in the helicopters.
A bloke wearing a flight helmet and flecktarn camo fatigues hopped out of Easy Money and came toward me. He took off his helmet.
"Nice to see you again Firebird" he shouted.
It was Count Bartholomu Bubury. President Of The Hellies and killer of the previous Gilly president. He walked up to me holding out his hand. I didn't take it.
"Have you switched sides on me?" he asked.
"I was never on your side. I'm not against you. But I'm not with you."
He brought his face uncomfortably close. "You're lucky I owed you a favor cuz you just cashed it in. If I ever see your face again you're going for a long walk out of a short helicopter."
He turned to address his minions. "Today we make history. Righteousness goes before us. Behind us we will leave footprints filled with Gilly blood!"
Dorktown followed Bubury into Easy Money. "Smell you later crocodile" she said to me.
I ran back into the Texaco and checked Dorktown's Firebuddy.
Dorktown had used my You Are Awaited account to accept Bubury's befriending request and communicate with him. I could see the log of their communications. She told him she had been deliberately driving the Pinto slowly to allow the Gilly army to keep up with us. She told him that they could expect to find the Gilly army at my factory in Seligman.
Dorktown was using my factory as bait.
A message from Laura popped up. "Mohawk Asshole has the factory surrounded. We're trapped. They've got both the main door and the evac tunnel. The weapons room is empty."
"Split up the cash reserves and hand them out to the employees" I replied. "Tell them it's severance pay and we'll have jobs for them in Norwood if they want them. I'll be there in fifteen minutes." Seligman was thirty minutes away.
The helicopters took off one by one. I begged the servo owner to loan me some petrol. I told him it would save the lives of dozens of factory workers. He shrugged. I promised to pay him back triple. No dice.
I sat down and folded my arms and laid my head down. I didn't know what to tell Laura. What do you say to a friend when you're leaving them to die? I'll make sure to stop by and bury you tomorrow?
Then a ghost on the CB radio warbled up through the fizz. And it sounded like the ghost said "Firebird."
I looked up.
Another voice responded. "10-9. Did not copy. What did you say his name was?"
This time the radio was loud and clear "His name is Firebird."
"10-4. Firebird is gonna build us some Firebirds" the second voice responded. "Eastbound and down. 10-10 in the wind. Over and out."
Then the owner noticed the Firebird symbol on my jacket. He looked outside and saw the Frankenbird. He looked back at me.
"You're Firebird!" he exclaimed. "You've been all over the air today. Everyone knows what happened in Van Nuys. Everyone knows you're on your way to Ohio to reopen the Firebird plant. Oh boy. Have I got something to show you."
"I have to get back to Seligman right now" I said.
"I'll get you back to Seligman. Just let me show you something first." He motioned for me to follow him into his office.
The office walls were covered in GM and Pontiac and Firebird memorabilia. Flags. Neon signs. Badges. Patches. Stickers. Framed and autographed prints from Smokey and the Bandit and even Hooper. He even had the actual Bandit Trans Am jacket that Burt Reynolds had owned. Who knows how he got a hold of that. Maybe he murdered Burt Reynolds.
"Did you own a Trans Am?" I asked.
"No. The Big Bang put an end to that dream."
"It's time to start dreaming again" I said. The best thing about being the hero is getting to say cool stuff like that.
"We're all rooting for you to get to Norwood. Why are you going turning around?" he asked.
"I'm gonna fight two armies at once" I explained. "I'm gonna lose. But if I survive I might save the lives of a couple dozen factory workers."
"We'd better get you back on the road" he said. He ran outside and started filling up the Frankenbird with petrol.
I got a bow and a knife out of the boot. I strapped the knife onto my belt and put the bow in the passenger seat. I headed back to Seligman.
The slowest of those helicopters could cruise at 200 kays. But they'd be getting there as the crow flies and I'd be getting there as the Firebird drives so I had to beat their 200 kays by a lot.
I put the pedal to the metal. First. Second. Third. Fourth. Redline. Tex's engine knew what it could give and knew what it could take. And boy did it make a hell of a racket.
I didn't know how fast I was going cuz the speedo didn't work but I promised myself if the Frankenbird made it there in time I'll give Tex's severed head a kiss on the lips. Ok maybe not that. Maybe I'd hire a plane to write his name in the sky or something.
I whizzed around that burned up tanker truck. I flew past the dead family in the upside down bug. I caught up to those Helly helicopters from hell and by the time I got to Seligman I was just ahead of them.
I slowed down the Frankenbird and crawled toward the factory while I sized up the situation. In the distance I could see that the deuce-and-a-half and the sand rail and the Elsinore were parked by the main door of the factory. Mohawk Asshole had managed to pry the door open a bit and was crawling in while Chumdumpster and the Flirties stood around outside. I had to get my people out of there before he murdered them all.
The factory's evac tunnel was a couple hundred meters long so the evac exit hatch was a couple hundred meters from the main door. The evac exit hatch was in the floor of a shack. I could see that the shack's door was open but the hatch in the floor was still sealed. One of the Flirties was in the shack trying to figure out how to open it. He had one of those shiny AK47s on him.
I figured the shack was my best bet. I floored it. When I got close to the shack I stomped on the emergency brake and spun the car around. The Frankenbird was pretty well armored but I wanted to be sure to save the headlights. I looked behind me and started backing up. The Flirty in the shack saw me coming and started shooting.
The Frankenbird smashed through the shack and knocked the whole thing down. I grabbed the bow and jumped out of the car but the Flirty was right there pointing his AK47 at me.
I was about to get killed by a dork in a blonde wig. But you know I didn't get killed cuz this book still has more pages in it.
We heard the helicopters approaching. The Flirty looked up to the sky and his head exploded. The helicopters were strafing the place with .50 caliber machine gun fire and rockets and grenades. The deuce was the next victim and the sand rail was next. Their tires popped and fluids went spraying.
The rest of the Flirty Dozen or maybe now I should call them the Flirty Eleven took cover and got out their shiny AK47s.
I pressed a button on my remote to open the hatch. Laura was down there waiting with her three year old kid in her arms. She shouted to the other employees who were lined up in the evac tunnel. She helped them out one by one.
I looked toward the main entrance. Mohawk Asshole had gotten the main factory door all the way open and he was hanging out down there doing god knows what. The Flirty Eleven went to war with the helicopters but one by one they were getting turned into cherry pie. Chumdumpster had noticed what I up to and he was headed my way on the Elsinore. Then the Pinto came flying out of the factory ramp piloted by Mohawk Asshole.
I bet it felt good to steal a car of mine for once.
I started firing arrows at Chumdumpster but they just bounced off his suit. I turned around to check on my workers. Laura and her kid were still by my side but the others were scattering into the distance. Farewell friends. We had a good run.
And it was just in time cuz at that moment I heard a big boom and I turned to see that the entire roof of my factory had caved in. Sorry world. No more Firebuddies for a while. And screw you Dorktown.
Ok now I kind of miss the way Dorktown used to read what I'd written and go in and type dumb stuff in between my paragraphs.
The helicopters were all coming in for a landing and kicking up dust. We were far enough away from the main door that the fascists in helicopters weren't paying attention to us but there were still quite a few bullets flying in random directions.
Chumdumpster was getting close. I grabbed a 2x4 that used to be part of the shack and swung it at Chumdumpster. I knocked him off the bike. Me and Laura and Laura's kid all got into the Frankenbird.
Mohawk Asshole got out of the Pinto and checked on Chumdumpster. Well he checked on his son I guess I should say. I'd never seen him act that way.
Chumdumpster was ok cuz of that silly suit. Mohawk Asshole looked back to see how his pretty army was doing. Needless to say they weren't doing quite so well.
The helicopters didn't stay on the ground long. They all started taking off again. It was not yet clear to me what the Hellies were up to but judging by the look he had on his face I think Mohawk Asshole must have known.
We got the hell out of there while the dust was still blowing and no one could see where we were going. We got away just fine but that didn't mean everything was a-ok cuz at that moment it became clear what the Hellies were up to.
A human being landed with a massive thud on the metal mesh that stood in for a windscreen on the Frankenbird. I slammed on the brakes.
The welds had held up but the whole thing was bent inward and the Frankenbird's roof was all out of shape.
The sad sack's face was right in front of me. It was one of the Flirties. I looked up at him. His blood was dripping all over me but he was still alive. For a few more seconds at least. He looked me in the eye. His mouth moved but he wasn't saying anything.
Me and Laura got out of the car and looked up. The Gilly soldiers were falling from the sky.CHAPTER 5: ash fork
When night came I snuck out of town with the headlights off. Once I was out of town I turned on the lights and picked up the pace. I kept my eyes to the sky looking for helicopters but because of that I didn't notice that Mohawk Asshole and Chumdumpster were following me in the Pinto and on the Elsinore.
I figured this out when they stopped being quiet about it and the Pinto started ramming the Frankenbird. And to make things worse the jerks who were tailing me hadn't been as careful as I was and they were being tailed by a Loach. Fortunately the Loach had no guns mounted on it so it wasn't shooting at us. I kicked it in the guts and the Frankenbird left them all behind.
It was outdriving my headlights probably going 200 kays when I saw that upside down bug. The upside down bug with the dead family inside. The upside down bug that was right before the wreckage of the tanker truck. The tanker truck that was splayed out across the entire road.
I stood on the brake pedal and all four wheels locked up. The tanker truck came into view but  the Frankenbird wasn't stopping. The tires screeched until I lightly bumped into truck.
I was gasping. I'd almost died but I didn't have time to dilly dally. Mohawk Asshole and Chumdumpster would be here any minute.
Then it hit me. They'd be here any minute. At top speed. With no headlights.
Now I know you probably bought this book cuz you like action and adventure. I hate to tell you this but that's not what this book is about. It's is about my life and Dorktown's life and our lives haven't always been good. Adventures don't always turn out how you want them to and action is something we'd all rather avoid. So you're not supposed to enjoy this part. I didn't.
I turned off the Frankenbird's lights. I slowly drove around the tanker. I turned around and parked fifty meters beyond it. I shut off the motor. I got out of the Frankenbird and waited in silence.
A minute later I heard the Pinto's engine approaching. The engine was screaming. Tex's carb was at the top of its game. The Elsinore and the chopper joined in the chorus.
Then there was a massive thud that shook the ground under my feet. No explosion. Just a thud.
Then there was a smaller thud and silhouetted against the stars was a humanlike figure spinning end over end. It was Chumdumpster. When he hit the ground his metal suit made a splash of sparks. He skidded right by me and off into the distance.
I grabbed my bow and walked back to the wreckage.
I'd wanted to make Mohawk Asshole explode just like he'd made my parents explode all those years ago. But that's not what happened. On the other side of that trailer there was a human being named Bruce Barbagallo. He was tangled up and dying inside of a crumpled pile of metal.
Now I'm no doctor but my diagnosis was that Bruce didn't really have legs anymore and he had about five minutes left before he found out which religion was the right one.
"Where's Steven?" he asked.
"Steven? Is that your son?"
"Yes. Steven."
I went over to the remains of the Elsinore and got my Six Million Dollar Man lunchbox full of money out of the saddlebag. "Steven's dead. Or mostly dead."
"Please let me see him" Bruce said.
"He's halfway to Gallup and still going."
"Tell him I love him more than anything."
"I'm not gonna tell him that."
"Please. Tell him I love him more than anything."
I sighed. "Ok."
The Loach came down for a landing behind us. The landing was slow and hesitant at first. Then it was sudden and awkward. I nocked an arrow and readied my bow but much to my surprise it was Dorktown who got out of the helicopter.
I lowered my bow. "You stole a helicopter?"
"I borrowed it" she said. "Is he dead?"
"No" I said.
"Good."
Dorktown reached into the mangled Pinto and started tugging on Bruce's arms.
"Dorktown stop it" I said. "You're gonna tear him in half."
"Do it you cunt" Bruce said.
I forced myself between them. "If you drop him out of that helicopter you're gonna make his death political."
"So what?" she said.
"So then this goddamn war is never gonna end."
"This war will end when we win it." She turned and went back to the helicopter. She returned with the crossbow and pointed it at me.
I readied my bow again and pointed it at her. "If you do this you're gonna hate yourself."
"I already hate myself."
"Think about what your pop would have wanted" I said.
Bruce spoke up. "Your pop? I thought you looked familiar. Your pop was the dumb guy."
"He wasn't dumb!" she shouted. "He was the smartest man I ever knew."
"He couldn't talk" Bruce said.
"He talked with his hands!" she replied.
"I was looking for John. Your pop knew where he was. But the only way I could get it out of him was if I had you there to translate."
"You tortured him and killed him while I watched. I was just a kid."
"I did what I had to do. To save the world."
"From what?" I asked.
"From you" he whispered.
I didn't have to include this part so consider yourself lucky. I'm writing this book so I get to write it like I'm the hero. When you're the hero you get to be powerful and confident. You can do whatever it takes to win and everyone will still like you. But every murderous dictator in human history thought they were saving the world. Pinochet thought he was saving the world. Hitler thought he was saving the world. Bruce thinks he was saving the world. Dorktown thinks she's saving the world. The Gillies and the Hellies sure do. And so do I.
That don't mean that nobody's right and nobody's really saving the world. I'm just saying that everyone's the hero of their own story. Even the villains. Especially the villains. Every atrocity throughout history was committed in the name of truth and justice. If someone's not willing to commit atrocities it's just cuz they ain't sure they're right.
Well on this night I must have been sure I was right cuz at this point I turned and shot my arrow into Bruce's heart. I could tell you about the look in his eyes or the sound that he made but I really don't want to do that. What I really want to do right now is delete this whole goddamned story and vanish off the face of the earth. But maybe there's some lesson to be learned from all of this. Maybe you can make some sense of it cuz I sure can't.
I looked up and saw Steven standing right there looking at me. I gasped and fell over backwards. Don't worry. Chumdumpster is not gonna stay Steven for long but right now he's Steven. I'd witnessed Bruce killing my family and now Steven had witnessed me killing his.
Steven's impressive tumble had been a death defying one. But his metal suit was leaking blood from every one of its cracks. He looked like a robot oozing hydraulic fluid.
I got up and backed away but he didn't come after me. Instead he reached into the car and tried to revive his very totally 100% dead dad.
"Your father wanted me to tell you that he loved you more than anything" I said.
Then Dorktown said "Your father dying was my reason for living." She turned the crossbow around and pointed it at her chest.
I threw my bow aside and ran to her but she pulled the trigger before I could get there. Fortunately she had the thing so close to her chest that the bolt didn't have anywhere to go. The crossbow flew out of her hands and she fell backwards onto the road. She hit her head and and then it was lights out.
I crouched down beside her. The bolt was lying on her chest. It had ripped through her clothing and she was bleeding but it had bounced off her sternum.
"If you die there won't be anyone left in my fan club" I said. I picked her up and started carrying her to the Frankenbird.
Chumdumpster climbed into the helicopter and managed to get it started. The rotors started spinning faster and faster. The thing looked like it was about to take flight but as soon as it left the ground it flipped over and landed on its side sending pieces of the rotors flying in every direction. Then the whole thing caught fire. Chumdumpster walked out of the flames like it was nothing.
Then he went over to that upside down Volkswagen convertible and flipped the whole thing over. He threw out the dead dad in the driver's seat but left the rotting corpses of the wife and kids sitting where they were. He got in and managed to get the car started. He took off with his new zombie family riding alongside him. Creepy as fuck.
I got Dorktown into the Frankenbird and got it started. We peeled out of there and left the bug behind.
 At this point I didn't even want to go to Norwood anymore. I just headed east cuz I didn't know where else to go.
I have a car. I have money. I have fuel. But I've lost my soul.
I wanted to put distance between me and what I'd done. But no matter how far I drove it was right there with me. I drove all night. The sun came up and burned my eyes. I kept going.
Finally I gave up. I stopped the car and got out. Dorktown came back to life and got out of the car too.
"What is this place?" she asked.
"Cadillac Ranch" I answered.
"What's Cadillac Ranch?"
"This place."
Cadillac Ranch is nothing more than a place where some cars are lined up and buried halfway in the dirt sticking up almost vertically. The place was strange enough but to make it even stranger someone had left a piano out there as well.
"You were out for ten hours" I said.
"I said I'd sleep when Mohawk Asshole was dead."
We climbed onto one of the cars and had a seat in the boot. Dorktown's arm was pressed against mine. It was nice. I usually tried not to touch her but I liked it when every now and then she'd touch me. But don't go getting any ideas. If you haven't figured out what we are to each other by now then you ain't never gonna figure it out.
"Why didn't you let me do it?" she asked.
I didn't say anything. I wasn't sure which "it" she was talking about but either way I think she knew.
"Thank you" she said.
Not much happened for a while.
There's a thing called narrative filigree where a writer will write a bunch of fancy sounding stuff just to take up some space. I maybe would have done something like that right now but I'm not a writer. I'm just someone who's trying to tell you a bunch of stuff that happened.
The weather wasn't hot or cold or stormy. No redtailed hawk cried out above us. No roadrunner dashed in front of us. There was nothing to hear. There was nothing to see. Nothing to do. Texas was flat and lovely and we sat there and her arm was pressed against mine.
Dorktown climbed down off the car and took a seat at the piano. She started playing and singing. If that seems out of character to you well it seemed that way to me too. I didn't know she could play. I didn't know she could sing. And if I'd known she could do that stuff I sure as heck wouldn't have ever thought that she would.
But a funny thing about character is that it can change.
The song she played for me was Close To You by The Carpenters. The lullaby my mom used to sing to me as a child.
Then she said "Let's go build some cars."
"I'm a murderer Dorktown."
"You're not a murderer. You're just a killer." She grabbed my hand and dragged me out of the car's boot. "You spent all of the last book and most of this one trying to convince us you were a coldblooded killer. Now that you've actually killed someone you're sad about it?"CHAPTER 6: NORWOOD
There never was and there never will be another century like the twentieth. In the twentieth century things were invented more quickly than they ever were before. After millennia of stagnation suddenly in the twentieth century every decade was totally different from the one before it. Hundreds of generations of subsistence farmers then out of nowhere someone's kid builds a rocket that lands on the moon.
Yay another rant about economics!!
That's right Dorktown. I appreciate your enthusiasm.
In the hundred years of the twentieth century we figured out more stuff than we had figured out in the hundred thousand years that preceded it. Sure there were some big things we figured out back in those days too. Fire. The wheel. Agriculture and domestication. Spoken language and written language and the printing press. But that ain't much to figure out in a hundred thousand years.
Here's a list of some stuff that was either invented or perfected in the twentieth century. Electricity. Antibiotics. Vaccines. Anesthetics. Surgery. Birth control. Air conditioning. Home appliances. Telephones. Photography. Radio. Rock music. Movies. Television. Computers. Cars. Airplanes. Jet engines. Rockets. Nuclear power. Norman Borlaug's miracle strains of wheat. You forgot about that one didn't you.
The twentieth century?? I wasn't even born yet!!
Were you even listening?
Norman Borlaug saved a billion lives.
That's my girl.
Most of that stuff I mentioned was figured out in the USA. What was it that the USA got right? If we asked Karl Marx he would have said it was capitalism that got us there but then he would have gone on to tell us that capitalism was doomed and it was destined to be replaced with something better. I'm not so sure. Capitalism sucked but it was better than anything else we could come up with.
Nowadays we got anarchy. Anarchy ain't too bad except every now and then someone comes along and seizes the means of production.
What's your point??
There is no point. It's a long drive to Ohio.
I can't believe you're letting me drive!! I thought I could only drive in emergencies!!
There are no rules anymore. And I needed some sleep. But I was kidding. There is a point. The point is we're not just going to Norwood to build cars. We're going to Norwood to pick up where the twentieth century left off.
Late the next day we were in Sin City Ohio. We picked up a map at a servo. The factory wouldn't be hard to find. We'd head northeast on Route 22 and pull off when we saw the signs for General Motors and Fisher Body.
We found it all right. But there wasn't much left of the place. Hundreds of broken windows. Bricks. Cinder blocks. Concrete. Iron. Steel. Graffiti over peeling paint. Pipes. Fans. Ducts. Rafters. Dust. Rubbish. Debris. Tools. Stairs without railings. Railings without stairs. Break rooms and a cafeteria. Washrooms. Lockers. Offices. Desks. Chairs. Typewriters. United Auto Workers posters. Pigeons. Bugs. Grass and trees and other bits of nature reclaiming the space once staked out for use by humans.
