10pm Friday, September 28. Suspect known only as "Dweller 6969", Deadline's evil fraternal twin, was seen cavorting shortly after his brother's disappearance.

Found at the crime scene 11:07pm Friday, September 28. This is probably unrelated as it was recently discovered that a Wasteland Communication Corporation employee is actually known by this moniker.

<br>
Crime scene overview 11:18pm Friday, September 28. I do not always agree with the opinions published in the Wastelander, but I promise to remain impartial. Because of this promise I have determined there is no conflict of interest and due to that determination I have ruled myself out as a suspect.

Crime scene 11:30pm Friday, September 28. Signs of a struggle or something, who knows. It's late and I'm getting sleepy. There's a potato with writing on it, maybe that's a clue, I dunno.

<br>
Saturday morning, September 29. With a good night's sleep and a clear head, I am back on the case. I'm carrying around a radio and it's a good thing because The Swede just said Deadline was last seen at Civil Defense. Civil Defense publishes a rival newspaper called the Daily Bugle.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/evidence_013.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/evidence_013_s.jpg"></a>

<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/evidence_015.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/evidence_015_s.jpg"></a>
<br>
Suspect Warden PeCo of Civil Defense, acting like he doesn't know where Deadline is. This guy can talk. He did mention Eaters and the Killtower Faction. Suspect Trav'lyn Ruze also mentioned "kill tower" via an electronic communique so maybe there's something to this.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">

<br>
Civil Defense told me to talk to suspects Digits and Doc, pictured. I was told to come back after the swimsuit competition. I took a nap and came back and these two told me to go talk to Civil Defense. Ah good, a few hours wasted.

<br>
Someone at the WCC claimed the Rust Devils threw a grenade at them. I brought along Mad Kelli for security and I interviewed the Rust Devils under the pseudonym Thunderbird since they're no friends of mine for unrelated reasons. That interview yielded nothing.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/deadline_2point0.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/deadline_2point0_s.jpg"></a>
<br>
On Oct 6, for the purposes of maintaining order and spelling accuracy at The Wastelander, I created a semi-interactive artificial intelligence called Deadline 2.0. I don't know how helpful it's going to be but we've got to do <i>something</i>.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/submission_1.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/submission_1_s.jpg"></a>
<br>
On Oct 17, I received three anonymous submissions from a suspect named Kate. This one clearly shows some suspects contaminating my crime scene.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/submission_2.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/submission_2_s.jpg"></a>

<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/kcdc.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/kcdc_s.jpg"></a>
I received this clue in the mail on Oct 16. Yeah that's my real address. If you kidnapped Deadline, come knock on my door, motherfucker.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/save_deadline.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/save_deadline_s.jpg"></a>
<br>
HOLY SHIT A HIDDEN MESSAGE
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/ominous.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/ominous_s.jpg"></a>
<br>
Finding the hidden message on Nov 26 inspired me to check back issues of The Wastelander for clues. RRH stands for "Red Right Hand," some sort of evil mythical power.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/rrh.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/rrh_s.jpg"></a>
<br>
Suspect Critical Biggs (AKA Critical Biggz) of the Rust Devils (no friends of mine for unrelated reasons) is practically admitting he's RRH. And Deadline would never have published this crap unless he were under duress.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/ruze.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/ruze_s.jpg"></a>
<br>
On Dec 7 I finally got a chance to interview suspect Trav'lyn Ruze about the Killtower Faction. She said she had just heard Deadline was investigating it. She had heard that he had returned safely from the investigation. When I expressed dissatisfaction with the usefulness of this information, she simply said, "My name is Ruze, what did you expect?"
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/grotch.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/grotch_s.jpg"></a>

Suspect Grotch tries to deflect suspicion by loudly proclaiming its support for the cause with a SAVE DEADLINE t-shirt.

<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/fox.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/fox_s.jpg"></a>
<br>
Another suspect, Desert Fox, also clearly wants us to think she supports the cause. But I won't be fooled!

<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/adept.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/adept_s.jpg"></a>

<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/deadline_hologram.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/deadline_hologram_s.jpg"></a>
<br>
At the Wastelanders Ball on Jan 5, 2019, I was shocked to discover that my creation, the machine intelligence known as Deadline 2.0, had escaped captivity and become an independent 3D projection.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/grotch_hat.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/grotch_hat_s.jpg"></a>
<br>
The WCC should really keep better track of this hat. I hope Grotch cleaned out the remnants of beef jerky stuck to that thing before it put it on.
</div>

<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/ap.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/ap_s.jpg"></a>
<br>
During the Winter Games Almost Patton delivered this clue that proves Deadline did intend to release 4 issues of the Wastelander. There was no sign of Deadline 2.0. Maybe someone tripped over his power cord.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/cm.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/cm_s.jpg"></a>
<br>
I received a tip that Grotch might have seen Deadline even after Civil Defense "last" saw him. Here it is wearing a ceremonial headdress and screen printing some Save Deadline merchandise it probably plans to sell for a profit to support its <a href="https://cultofcatmeat.com">"church."</a>
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/sd.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/sd_s.jpg"></a>
<br>
The lady doth protest too much methinks. It who crows the most knows the most. It who makes the headlines kidnapped Deadline. Grotch is now the lead suspect in this case.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
People don't threaten to do shit. They just do it. People don't get murdered with 4000 people standing around and nobody seeing anything.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
Why don't these clues make any sense? Is someone trying to throw me off the scent? Why would the WCC hire a corrupt sheriff and a lazy fuck with no experience to investigate the most important case in its history?
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
Then it hit me. They don't <i>want</i> Deadline to be found.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
At this point the investigation proceeded in secret. I did not want to reveal Deadline's whereabouts to the world if he did not want to be found. I posted on this site and elsewhere that I'd given up on the investigation.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/fc_on_the_case.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/fc_on_the_case_s.jpg"></a>
Firecracker was matched to Deadline on You Are Awaited for Detonation 2019. She agreed to let us work with her to find her match. Pictured are Almost Patton, Firecracker, and Bad Liar.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
We had one clue. Deadline's You Are Awaited profile was a long sentence in Morse code. Coyote Snack figured out that the first letter of every word spelled "potato."
</div>

<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/motormouth_and_ravage.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/motormouth_and_ravage_s.jpg"></a>

The recording told us to find the Mad Scientist. The Mad Scientist had brainwashed Deadline with a potion. The Mad Scientist was the only one with the antidote. The Mad Scientist would only give up the cure if we agreed to find him a victim to drink the Dragon's Breath. Bad Liar bravely volunteered.

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
There's more going on here. Why was the WCC trying to derail its own investigation? Why was this all set up like a wild goose chase? Where did the tapeless audio recorder come from?
