10pm Friday, September 28. Suspect known only as "Dweller 6969", Deadline's evil fraternal twin, was seen cavorting shortly after his brother's disappearance.

Found at the crime scene 11:04pm Friday, September 28. This article was not published. It may have been intended for publication on Saturday, September 29. Did someone kidnap Deadline to keep this article from ever seeing the light of day?

Found at the crime scene 11:07pm Friday, September 28. This is probably unrelated as it was recently discovered that a Wasteland Communication Corporation employee is actually known by this moniker.

Crime scene overview 11:18pm Friday, September 28. I do not always agree with the opinions published in the Wastelander, but I promise to remain impartial. Because of this promise I have determined there is no conflict of interest and due to that determination I have ruled myself out as a suspect.

Crime scene 11:30pm Friday, September 28. Signs of a struggle or something, who knows. It's late and I'm getting sleepy. There's a potato with writing on it, maybe that's a clue, I dunno.

Saturday morning, September 29. With a good night's sleep and a clear head, I am back on the case. I'm carrying around a radio and it's a good thing because The Swede just said Deadline was last seen at Civil Defense. Civil Defense publishes a rival newspaper called the Daily Bugle.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/evidence_013.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/evidence_013_s.jpg"></a>
<br>
Forager Pace of Civil Defense, trying to act innocent.

<br>
Warden PeCo of Civil Defense, acting like he doesn't know where Deadline is. This guy can talk. He did mention Eaters and the Killtower Faction. Suspect Trav'lyn Ruze (not pictured) also mentioned "kill tower" so maybe there's something to this.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/evidence_016.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/evidence_016_s.jpg"></a>

Cool patch dude but where's Deadline?

Maybe this is related. It's time for my afternoon nap.

<br>
Civil Defense told me to talk to suspects Digits and Doc, pictured. I was told to come back after the swimsuit competition. I took a nap and came back and these two told me to go talk to Civil Defense. Ah good, a few hours wasted.
</div>

Someone at the WCC claimed the Rust Devils threw a grenade at them. I brought along Mad Skelli for security and I interviewed the Rust Devils under the pseudonym Thunderbird since they're no friends of mine for unrelated reasons. That interview yielded nothing.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
Mad Skelli then asked some random person, "Where's Deadline?" They said he was in Vault 77. But no one would tell us where that was. After threatening to shoot a few people in the kneecaps, Mad Skelli found out that the secret Vault 77 was either inside or around the Mushroom Cloud Lounge. But at this point it was Sunday. The Mushroom Cloud lounge had vanished from the site, along with the entire Gathering of the Tribes compound.

<br>
On Oct 6, for the purposes of maintaining order and spelling accuracy at The Wastelander, I created a semi-interactive artificial intelligence called Deadline 2.0. I don't know how helpful it's going to be but we've got to do <i>something</i>.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
On the evening of Sunday Oct 7, someone claiming to be Deadline signed up for a You Are Awaited mission at the Wastelanders Ball on January 5. It's possible Dweller 6969 will show up instead, or the computer-generated Deadline 2.0 will make an appearance. If Deadline himself shows up, the next question will be: Will he have copies of the never-printed Wastelander vol. II no. 4? I'm dying to find out if the First Feral Family had sex with mutants.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/submission_1.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/submission_1_s.jpg"></a>
<br>
On Oct 17, I received three anonymous submissions from someone named Kate. This one clearly shows some suspects contaminating my crime scene.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/submission_2.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/submission_2_s.jpg"></a>
Another anonymous submission from Kate.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/submission_3.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/submission_3_s.jpg"></a>
Yet another anonymous submission from the anonymous Kate.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/kcdc.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/kcdc_s.jpg"></a>
I received this clue in the mail on Oct 16. Yeah that's my real address. If you kidnapped Deadline, come knock on my door, motherfucker.
</div>

<div class="profile_search_block" style="width:200px;vertical-align:top;">
<a target="_blank" href="/images/fun/save_deadline/firebird_on_the_case.jpg"><img src="/images/fun/save_deadline/firebird_on_the_case_s.jpg"></a>
I will not rest until Deadline is found, or until I get sleepy again, whichever comes first!
</div>

<h1>Theories</h1>
<div class="profile_search_block">
One theory is he got sick of doing the Wastelander and wanted a night off to do karaoke, so he kidnapped himself and faked his own death and came back as his own evil twin.
<br><br>
"Is he alive? Dead? Chained to a desk at the Bunker Bugle?"--Deadline 2.0
<br><br>
"Dweller 6969 has nothing to do with this."--Dweller 6969
<br><br>
Another theory is that someone spilled a drink on Deadline's typewriter, rendering it useless, and the WCC decided to quickly come up with a more elaborate explanation that did not make them seem like they're a bunch of bumbling dolts.
<br><br>
Trav'lyn Ruze: "I keep saying that deadline is time traveling rn, but no one will listen."<br>
Firebird: "How do you know this?"<br>
Trav'lyn Ruze: "...kill tower."
