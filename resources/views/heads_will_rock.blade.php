"Not many people have written books in the past 38 years. So nowadays every book that gets written sort of has to be a history book and a philosophy book and a survival book too. I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't tell you what I know about how things got to be the way they are and offer you some ideas about how to get things back to the way they were."

<p>
This is the story of how we killed some people while trekking across the USA on Route 66 trying to rediscover the American Dream. 22000 words. 110 pages. 5 illustrations. Short sentences. No commas. No descriptions. Words and actions only. Give me two hours of your life. I'm not gonna waste your time.
