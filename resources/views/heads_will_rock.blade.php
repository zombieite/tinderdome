"Not many people have written books in the past 38 years. So nowadays every book that gets written sort of has to be a history book and a philosophy book and a survival book too. I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't tell you what I know about how things got to be the way they are and offer you some ideas about how to get things back to the way they were."

A girl named Dorktown inspires both Firebird and his nemesis, Mohawk Asshole, to battle it out to achieve the same goal: to build the first new cars the world has seen since the apocalypse. Firebird and Mohawk Asshole both make plans to recommission an old General Motors factory. Dorktown reveals to Firebird that Mohawk Asshole is their common enemy. They agree to cooperate in killing him. The war between the Hellies and the Gillies escalates and they burn down Tomorrowland Weekend. Firebird saves Dorktown from the flames.
