<h2>Find thems you're looking for and thems you've lost</h2>
<p>
Since The Big Bang happened, Wasteland has become known the world over as the place we come to find thems we're looking for and thems we've lost. Whether you're looking for love, a friend you haven't met yet, an enemy you haven't battled yet, or someone you knew once and lost, without telephones or a reliable post office we need a designated meeting place. That's Wasteland.
</p>
<p>
On this site you will create a profile that is as brief, mysterious, and information-free as you like. Individuals, couples, or groups can create profiles. Then you'll mark some other profiles as ones you'd enjoy being matched with. A few days before the next Wasteland event you can check your profile page to see if you have a mutual match. Your mission is to find them at the event. They'll be looking for you, too.
</p>
<p>
When you meet, there's no need for small talk. The subject of conversation is predetermined. You are to merge the backstories of your Wasteland personas. You'll come up with a story of how you met. The story can be realistic (we just met here today at this Wasteland event) or wild (we fought each other in a battle 200 years ago before we were both cryogenically frozen) or romantic (we were once in love but haven't seen each other since The Big Bang separated us ten years ago). If your backstories are utterly incompatible, you can each declare the other one to be insane.

If you come together to find me, Firebird, and tell me your story, I'll reward you with special caps. <a href="/profile/1">Here's my profile</a>.
