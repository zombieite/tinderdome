<p class="p1">We hear the voice of a <a href="/1981/radio_announcer_with_music.mp3">RADIO ANNOUNCER</a> with an Aussie accent.</p>

<p class="character">RADIO ANNOUNCER</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="dialogue">In the US territory of Puerto Rico, explosions destroyed several Air National Guard aircraft. Police suspect it was yet another act of terrorism in a wave of violent rebellion sweeping the US.... Researchers in South Africa have identified several new cases of a mysterious and deadly immune deficiency disease affecting young men. The researchers suspect that the mens' illnesses are all being caused by the same unidentified virus.</div></p>

<p class="p1">DEBBY, a punk-rock girl with long brassy blonde hair, sits propped up in bed with a music box on her pregnant tummy. She is turning the crank of a music box, playing Happy Birthday. Debby doesn't play the last three notes of Happy Birthday because she is interrupted by the sound of a ringing timer coming from the kitchen. She sets the music box down and leaves the room. We can now see BRUCE asleep in the same bed. He slept in a work cap and a denim work vest. Inexplicably, on his bottom half Bruce is wearing only his underwear, and his underwear is nothing more than a g-string that shows off his buttocks. Bruce's cap and vest have been heavily personalised to make them look more punk. On one side of Bruce's vest there is a nametag patch. On the other side there is a patch with the company logo of 7 Sisters Petroleum. Above the 7SP patch Bruce has written &quot;I DRINK&quot; [7 SISTERS PETROLEUM].</p>

<p class="p3"><div class="dialogue">Biologist Paul Ehrlich (ERR-lick) predicts hundreds of millions will starve, and the prices of raw materials will continue to skyrocket over the next decade. He predicts oil reserves will be depleted in 20 to 30 years. Oil prices have more than tripled, leading prime minister Fraser (&quot;FRAY-zer&quot;) to announce this morning that Australia's oil resources have been nationalised and will now be managed exclusively by the government.</div></p>

<p class="p1">Bruce's coworker ZED is waiting outside, wearing a grey work vest with a white shirt under it, and an light-blue bandana around his neck. Zed is banging on the door and shouting in a manner that is rudely inappropriate for the time of day.</p>

<p class="character">ZED</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="dialogue">Wake up slacker! 7 Sisters Petroleum, fuelling the world!</div></p>

<p class="p1">Bruce rushes out the door. Zed tries to peek in the door but Bruce immediately slams it shut. They both start heading off to work but then we hear Debby inside whistling the distinctive call of the grey butcherbirds of Werrington, New South Wales. Bruce forgot the sandwiches. He immediately replies with the same whistle and returns to the door. Zed wonders about the purpose of their whistle, but he imitates it successfully, without Bruce or Debby hearing him. The door opens. Debby hands Bruce a bag with the sandwiches in it.</p>

<p class="character">BRUCE</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="dialogue">If it weren't for you, I'd tear this whole bloody world to the ground.</div></p>

<p class="p3"><div class="dialogue">American economist Deanna Binns has been invited to address the Australian parliament later this year. Binns believes that Australia should adopt economic policies similar to those of Chile's (&quot;CHILL-eez&quot;) reactionary dictatorship. With unemployment and inflation both over twenty percent, these controversial reforms are just as likely to devastate Australia's economy as they are to save it.... A $250,000 reward has been offered for information related to the recent bombings of several Woolworths stores. The reward is the largest ever offered in Australian history.... The Tynong (&quot;TIE-nong&quot;) North and Frankston murders remain unsolved after three more women's bodies were found last month.... And speaking of serial killers, now back to the music. This song is about Brenda Spencer, a 16-year-old girl who shot up a school. It's the Boomtown Rats, with &quot;I Don't Like Mondays.&quot;</div></p>

<p class="location">7SP FIELD OFFICE EXTERIOR - MORNING</p>
<p class="p1">The 7 Sisters Petroleum office is run down. There's graffiti on the sign by the front door. NEIL is leaning under the open bonnet of a car, trying to work on the engine as best he can while in a wheelchair. He is dressed in a white work vest with a yellow shirt under it, and a dark blue bandana around his neck. Bruce and Zed arrive at work. Both of them are eating their sandwiches. Zed talks with his mouth full.</p>

<p class="character">ZED</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="dialogue">One date so far.</div></p>
<p class="p1">Bruce moves to attack Zed but Neil grabs his arm. Bruce tugs so hard that he pulls Neil's wheelchair sideways.</p>
<p class="character">NEIL</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="dialogue">Pay him no mind. The last woman he was inside was his mother. He's not going to try anything with Debby. Not with you around.</div></p>
<p class="p1">Neil lets Bruce go. Bruce feigns another attack and Zed flinches. Bruce walks away and begins work on another nearby vehicle. PAPPAGALLO appears. He is a middle-aged businessman wearing a 70s suit and a wide tie. Pappagallo has a clipboard with a list of employees' names on it. He has drawn lines through the names of some of the employees, and circled others. We see him circling Bruce's name.</p>
<p class="character">PAPPAGALLO</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="dialogue">Bruce, can I speak to you for a moment?</div></p>
<p class="p1">Neil and Zed make schoolboy sounds, as though they are making fun of Bruce for being in trouble with the principal. Bruce and Pappagallo leave the shop area so they are out of earshot of the others.</p>
<p class="character">ZED</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="dialogue">I've had lots of girlfriends. I still have the presents they gave me.</div></p>
<p class="p1">Zed opens his pocket and pulls out a locket, an earring, a button, a toy figurine, a seashell, and a barrette. Neil ignores him.</p>
<p class="character">PAPPAGALLO</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="dialogue">
As you've probably heard we're being nationalised. We all knew it was coming. So I took steps to ensure that when they come to take my company from me, there will be nothing left to take. As of today I've dissolved the company. I've burned all the maps, all the survey data, all the employee records. 7 Sisters Petroleum is no more. I'll pay you what I owe you by the end of the day.</div></p>

<p class="character">PAPPAGALLO</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="dialogue">This doesn't have to be the end. A few of us are going out to one of the oil donkeys to build a little refinery around it. We'll use the fuel to barter for everything we need. We'll start a new life while the rest of the world goes to the dogs.</div></p>
<p class="character">BRUCE</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="dialogue">That oil doesn't belong to you. It belongs to everyone.</div></p>
<p class="character">PAPPAGALLO</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="dialogue">
That may be, but it takes guys like me to get it out of the ground. It takes our engineers to turn it into something everyone can use. And it takes guys like you to keep the trucks running. And that's why I'd like you to come with us. You're the best mechanic we've got.</div></p>

<p class="p1">Bruce turns and walks away. His manner suggests Pappagallo has touched a nerve. Pappagallo grabs him and stops him from leaving.</p>

<p class="character">PAPPAGALLO</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="dialogue">Is that it? You lost your parents? Well you know what? We all lose our parents. If we're lucky enough to live that long.</div></p>

<p class="p1">Bruce punches Pappagallo and knocks him over. Zed runs to Pappagallo's aid. Bruce leaves and starts walking home. Zed helps Pappagallo up. Pappagallo nods and mutters a few words. He waves to Zed to join him in his office. Zed jumps and cheers.</p>

<p class="p1">Pappagallo dumps petrol onto the exterior of the 7 Sisters Petroleum building. We see a closeup of his face as he lights a match and throws it. We hear the whomp and crackle of a fire starting. Pappagallo's face is lit up in progressively brighter yellow and orange light.</p>

<p class="p1">Bruce and the other former employees of 7 Sisters Petroleum are hard at work building Pappagallo's compound. Saws are grinding and sparks are flying. Pappagallo is approached by an employee who informs him about something we can't hear. He walks across the compound and takes Bruce aside with a solemn look on his face.

<p class="p3"><div class="dialogue">Bruce, I don't know how to tell you this, but I just got word that... that Debby is uh... Debby was uh... killed.</div></p>
<p class="p1">Bruce's emotions go from sadness to primal rage, and he attacks Pappagallo.</p>
<p class="character">BRUCE</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="dialogue">Zed. Zed did this! I'm going to kill him! I'm going to kill all of you! Kill! Kill! Kill!</div></p>
<p class="p1">The other compound dwellers restrain Bruce. In the fray, Bruce's hat falls off, revealing that his hair is cut into a red mohawk.</p>

<p class="p1">We see Pappagallo's employee list, burning. We see Bruce's name and address, as we did earlier. But now we see that there is a section for &quot;Notes&quot; as well. The notes section beside Bruce's name reads, &quot;Hometown--Werrington NSW (nickname 'Wez').&quot;</p>

<p class="location">HOUSE INTERIOR, KITCHEN - NIGHT</p>

<p class="p1">Zed bends over. He takes the music box from Debby's dead hand and puts it into his pocket of trinkets.</p>

<p class="character">RADIO ANNOUNCER</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="dialogue">Police suspect the killer strangles his victims, as no murder weapon has been found. The killer steals a trinket from each of his victims to keep as a souvenir.... Prime minister Fraser (&quot;FRAY-zer&quot;) has declared that stage three of the national emergency is effective immediately. Citizens are warned (radio cuts off and all we can hear is static). </div></p>

<p class="camera">FADE OUT.</p>

<p class="end">THE END</p>
