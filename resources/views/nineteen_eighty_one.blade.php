The researchers suspect that the mens' illnesses are all being caused by the same unidentified virus.</div></p>

<p class="p1" style="">DEBBY, a punk-rock girl with long brassy blonde hair, sits propped up in bed with a music box on her pregnant tummy. She is turning the crank of a music box, playing Happy Birthday. Debby doesn't play the last three notes of Happy Birthday because she is interrupted by the sound of a ringing timer coming from the kitchen. She sets the music box down and leaves the room. We can now see BRUCE asleep in the same bed. He slept in a work cap and a denim work vest. Inexplicably, on his bottom half Bruce is wearing only his underwear, and his underwear is nothing more than a g-string that shows off his buttocks. Bruce's cap and vest have been heavily personalised to make them look more punk. On one side of Bruce's vest there is a nametag patch. On the other side there is a patch with the company logo of 7 Sisters Petroleum. Above the 7SP patch Bruce has written &quot;I DRINK&quot; [7 SISTERS PETROLEUM].</p>

A $250,000 reward has been offered for information related to the recent bombings of several Woolworths stores. The reward is the largest ever offered in Australian history.... The Tynong (&quot;TIE-nong&quot;) North and Frankston murders remain unsolved after three more women's bodies were found last month.... And speaking of serial killers, now back to the music.

<p class="p1" style="">The bus is full of former 7 Sisters Petroleum employees waiting to begin the journey out to the oil donkey. Zed is sitting in a seat listening to his headphones. He's looking out the window.</p>

<p class="p1" style="">Pappagallo dumps petrol onto the exterior of the 7 Sisters Petroleum building. We see a closeup of his face as he lights a match and throws it. We hear the whomp and crackle of a fire starting. Pappagallo's face is lit up in progressively brighter yellow and orange light.</p>

<p class="p1" style="">INTERCUT:</p>

<p class="p1" style="">Debby hears the whistle and looks up. She stops playing the music box, leaving the last two notes of Happy Birthday unplayed. She whistles back, runs to the front door, and opens it. We cut to Zed's POV of Debby's face as the door opens.</p>

<p class="p1" style="">CUT TO:</p>
<p class="p1" style="">OIL DONKEY COMPOUND - NIGHT</p>
<p class="p1" style=""> </p>
<p class="p1" style="">Bruce and the other former employees of 7 Sisters Petroleum are hard at work building Pappagallo's compound. Saws are grinding and sparks are flying. Pappagallo takes Bruce aside with a solemn look on his face. This scene is intentionally written and shot as an homage to the scene in Mad Max 2 in which Wez rages over the death of the Golden Youth.</p>

<p class="p1" style="">CUT TO:</p>
<p class="p1" style="">7SP FIELD OFFICE INTERIOR - NIGHT</p>
<p class="p1" style=""> </p>
<p class="p1" style="">We see Pappagallo's employee list, burning. We see Bruce's name and address, as we did earlier. But now we see that there is a section for &quot;Notes&quot; as well. The notes section beside Bruce's name reads, &quot;Hometown--Werrington NSW (nickname 'Wez').&quot;</p>

<p class="p1" style="">The title &quot;FORTY YEARS LATER&quot; appears on screen. GROWN FERAL KID from Mad Max 2/The Road Warrior is in his late 40s/early 50s now. He is wearing old clothing, but not animal skins. It's clear that some rebuilding of the world has taken place in the past forty years. He pulls out the same music box Debby held on her tummy 40 years earlier. He turns the crank until, finally, we hear the last note of the song: happy birthday, to... you. Credits announce that this film was created in celebration of the fortieth anniversary of Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior.</p>
