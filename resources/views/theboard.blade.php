FB selling tickets to an event called Tomorrowland Weekend, where postapocalyptic weirdos dress up as nonapocalyptic normies. DT introduces herself to FB, asks how to swap timelines. FB tries to get rid of her. She produces MA, introducing him as Bruce. Here because maybe FB can help HIM swap timelines. MA attacks FB, FB's fans grab MA, say no fighting except in the Cage. FB wants to keep up the charade, says no it's all right.

        <td>They say hi to Mad Skelli on the way to FB's trailer. It's clear that FB and MS still haven't figured out what their relationship is. In trailer FB asks what DT and MA are doing there. MA finds out his car was destroyed. FB and MA get the idea to rebuild a new version of the car they used to both covet. MA reveals that no one swaps timelines, leading to DT being mad and everyone at Tomorrowland Weekend wanting their money back. They get angry and burn the place down.
